<Accordion title="React: Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components">
    Controlled components are components whose value is directed/driven by React’s state. By state, we mean the state we store inside a React component, i.e., inside this.state or with useState.
    This means that these components will receive the latest changes.

    For any controlled component, we pass our state variable inside the value prop of the component. The function that changes this state variable of the component is passed in the onChange prop of the controlled component.
