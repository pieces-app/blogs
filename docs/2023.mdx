    It's worth noting some drawbacks associated with using a state management library, which include:

    - Complexity: Keeping a state management system is not easy. It is incredibly useful for development, but controlling it might be difficult.
    - Heavy: If you're creating a basic blog or a SPA (Single Page Application) with few activities, or if you only want to promote your idea and content, state management isn't for you because it stores "redundant" data.
