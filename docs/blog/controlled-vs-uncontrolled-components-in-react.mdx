# React: Controlled vs Uncontrolled Components

id="">Without further ado, let’s get started!
id=""><strong>Prerequisites</strong>
id="">To follow along with this article, I would highly recommend reading these articles for some background:
- id=""><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind" target="_blank">Bind function in JS</a>

## What is a Controlled Component?
id="">Controlled components are components whose value is directed/driven by React’s state. By state, we mean the state we store inside a React component, i.e., inside <em id="">this.state</em> or with <em id="">useState</em>.
id="">This means that these components will receive the latest changes.
id="">For any controlled component, we pass our state variable inside the <em id="">value</em> prop of the component. The function that changes this <em id="">state</em> variable of the component is passed in the <em id="">onChange</em> prop of the controlled component.
id="">Here is an example that demonstrates a controlled component:

id="">Let’s explain:
- id="">Its <em id="">render</em> method consists of a <em id="">form</em> with an <em id="">input</em> element and a <em id="">strong</em> element that displays the value of the state variable of the component.
- id="">We pass the state variable <em id="">inputValue</em> as a <em id="">value</em> prop to the input element.
- id="">Similarly, we pass the <em id="">handleOnChange</em> function to the <em id="">onChange</em> prop of the input component.
- id="">Now, whatever you type inside the input element will set the value of the <em id="">inputValue</em> state via <em id="">handleOnChange</em>, and then the same will be displayed in the <em id="">input</em> element.
- id="">To show that the state variable <em id="">inputValue</em> is changing, we display it inside the <em id="">strong</em> element.

id="">Here's a video for the above code:

id="">The controlled component’s <em id="">value</em> prop does not always need to be a component’s internal state. It can be a prop of the parent component, or it can come from the Redux store. This is similar to the <em id="">onChange</em> prop.
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62f42c8c5606d806c1b8a6b5_raycast-untitled%20(84).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A code snippet with React cod)
id="">In a similar manner, we can use <em id="">react-redux</em> to get the state and the <em id="">handleOnChange</em> function from the Redux store to have similar functionality to what we had when we were using <em id="">useState</em>.
id="">The same context can be applied to the checkbox, radio, text area, and select DOM elements so that they can act as controlled elements.

id="">Here are some of the advantages of using controlled components:
- id="">Form data can be passed between different components
- id="">The event handler and the value prop can be from the parent or a redux store
- id="">The React component acts as a source of truth for this component

id="">Some disadvantages of controlled components:
- id="">A controlled component can be a bad choice when large changes are required to be made to the component
id="">As the name suggests, the value of uncontrolled components is not driven by the React component’s state variable. It's completely controlled by the DOM.
id="">Uncontrolled components are generally used when the use case is simple or the action is not trackable; for example, a user uploading a file using file input.
id="">The basic requirement of any uncontrolled component is to be handled by the DOM. In this case, we cannot pass the <em id="">state</em> variable inside the form’s input element. Now the question arises — how are we going to set the value inside this input element?
id="">We use React’s <em id="">useRef</em> for functional components or <em id="">createRef</em> for class-based components. A <em id="">useRef</em> is a hook that returns a mutable object with <em id="">current</em> as its property with value being <em id="">initialValue</em> that is passed inside the hook.
id="">Here is the syntax of the <em id="">useRef</em> hook:

id="">A <em id="">ref</em> object can be used in many ways, e.g., as a state variable that does not re-render the component on change, to access DOM elements, etc.

id="">We can leverage this into our React uncontrolled component to access input elements attributes, i.e., value properties.
id="">Here's a simple example of how you can create an uncontrolled component:

![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62f42df7f09d03702f9c3405_raycast-untitled%20(87).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A code snippet with React cod)
id="">And here is what the above component will look like:

id="">As you can see, this <em id="">App</em> component consists of <em id="">form</em> and a bunch of <em id="">span</em> elements. We use the <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/" target="_blank" id="">JSON placeholder API</a> in the component to fetch the <em id="">post</em> based on <em id="">id</em>. This is the summary of our component, but let’s understand a bit more about how the <em id="">App</em> component works internally.
- id="">We are making use of a <em id="">ref</em> object here. This <em id="">ref</em> object is named as <em id="">selectRef</em> and this is being passed on to the <em id="">select</em> element as a <em id="">ref</em> prop.
- id="">Here comes the catch— we don’t need to watch for any changes that happen to the <em id="">select</em> element, nor do we need to make use of a state variable to keep track of the current value that is selected in this element.
- id="">This begs the question, how do we get the latest value from the <em id="">select</em> element?
- id="">Well, we don’t need to. This is an uncontrolled component/element; a component/element that is managed by the DOM.
- id="">So, the change in the <em id="">value</em> property of the select element is managed by the browser.
- id="">Now we just need to find a way to capture this value. <em id="">refs</em> comes to rescue here. Since we passed our <em id="">ref</em> object into the <em id="">select</em> element as a prop, we can now access the value present inside this element.
- id="">To get hang of this, you can check out the <em id="">handleOnSubmit</em> function. This function makes use of the <em id="">selectRef.current.value</em> to access the value property of the <em id="">select</em> element. The <em id="">selectRef</em> stores all of the values inside the <em id="">current</em> object. In this case, <em id="">selectRef.current</em> will store the <em id="">select</em> element itself. To access the value, simply access its <em id="">.value</em> property.
- id="">Next, the <em id="">handleOnSubmit</em> function calls the API. On success, we simply store it in the state variable <em id="">apiData</em>.

id="">Here are some advantages of uncontrolled components:
- id="">Browser DOM handles the changes to the element
- id="">Simple to use
- id="">Keeps track of the internal state
id="">And some of the disadvantages of uncontrolled components:
- id="">It’s not always efficient to use uncontrolled components where we require granular control over the value

## <a href="https://formik.org/" target="_blank">Formik</a>
id="">Formik is an open-source library to build forms in React and React Native. It’s the world’s leading library for building forms in React.
id="">Formik is a complete solution that helps you to implement form validation, keep track of visited fields, and handle form submission in an efficiently and robustly. It's based on the concept of a controlled component react.
id="">Now, let’s look at one simple example of how can Formik can be used to build a form along with the form validation.
id="">We are going to use the same uncontrolled component example. First, we’ll convert the example into a controlled component and then, use Formik to make our life easier.

![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62f52af74f9c70097ce76bea_raycast-untitled%20(94).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A code snippet with a React componen)

id="">Here are some of the brief points that will get you up to speed on understanding the above component:
- id=""><em id="">Formik</em> is a wrapper component that helps to build forms.
- id="">It takes in <em id="">initialValues</em>, which tells the Formik form about the fields and their initial values.
- id="">Next, we have the <em id="">validationSchema</em> prop. It can accept a <a href="https://github.com/jquense/yup" target="_blank" id="">Yup</a> object to define validations inside the form.
- id="">Finally, we provide our <em id="">submitHandler</em> function as a callback that needs to be executed whenever a submission takes place.
- id="">This is a controlled component. All the values are handled by Formik.
- id="">In the above component, we have used <em id="">Formik</em>, <em id="">Field</em> and <em id="">ErrorMessage</em> components. These are similar to the normal input elements present inside the form element.
- id="">The <em id="">Field</em> component, as the name suggests, acts as a wrapper component on top of form input elements.
- id="">Finally, we have the <em id="">ErrorMessage</em> component. This component takes in the <em id="">name</em> prop. This <em id="">name</em> prop will be used by this component to provide an element that displays the error message for that particular field.
- id="">Now, you might be wondering how these components know which field they should work for. Here comes the <em id="">name</em> and <em id="">id</em> props to the rescue. You should provide either of these props to make sure your <em id="">Field</em> and <em id="">ErrorMessage</em> components work properly.
- id="">We should also make sure that we pass the submitted values to Yup’s <em id="">validations</em> that we set earlier. &nbsp;For example, for the select field, we pass in <em id="">name="selectVal"</em> in the <em id="">Field</em> and <em id="">ErrorMessage</em> components. In this way, Formik knows how to map these wrapper components to their respective fields.
id="">Finally, here is our outcome with form validation in place with the help of Formik:

## Summary
id="">Now, you've learned some of the differences of React controlled vs uncontrolled components. Choosing which type of component to use in your project completely depends upon your use case.
id="">If you’re looking for tangible results with a simple use case or trying to use memory-intensive operations, such as document editors, uncontrolled components are the way to go.
