# The Guide to VS Code Snippets
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p id="">A software developer’s job mainly involves writing production code. It’s easy to find yourself typing the same lines of code repeatedly as you work. This repetitive and inefficient task can certainly begin to feel mundane after a while, and as a result, your coding workflow may start to look like a chore. One solution to this problem is to use code snippets to speed up and simplify the coding process. In this article, you’ll learn more about code snippets and how to create them in the Visual Studio (VS) code editor. In the end, you’ll also see how <a href="https://code.pieces.app/" id="">Pieces for Develoeprs</a> makes saving, using, and sharing VS code snippets even easier.<p.new.line><h2 id="">What are Code Snippets?<h2.new.line><p id="">Code snippets are ready-made bits of reusable source code that you can save for reuse as needed. With code snippets, you can quickly insert the chunks of reusable code into your codebase, reducing the time you would spend repeatedly typing the same code and thus significantly speeding up your development workflow.<p.new.line><p id="">Generally speaking, it’s preferable to avoid repetition when there’s an obvious solution: You save contacts on your phone instead of typing the numbers for every phone call, and you let websites store cookies on your computer to remember your log-in details and preferences.

Follow the steps in the tutorial below to get started.<p.new.line><h3 id="">Step 1: Create a Snippet File<h3.new.line><p id="">VS Code snippets are written in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files that can define an unlimited number of snippets. To create a snippet, start by opening the command palette.
