# We Built one of the Top OCR Tools

<p id="">Code is everywhere you look these days - it’s written, copied, pasted and shared on websites, in videos and articles, in messengers like Slack or Discord, and, of course, in your tools. In the most frustrating cases, the code that you might want to rip and re-use in your project is buried inside an image or a YouTube video, requiring you to type each character out manually. We’re happy to eliminate that annoyance forever with the launch of <a href="http://codefromscreenshot.com/" target="_blank">CodeFromScreenshot.com</a>— one of the top OCR tools!<p.new.line><p id="">First released inside our flagship AI-powered code snippet tool, Pieces for Developers, (which is incredibly awesome and gives you superhuman speed when saving, re-using, and sharing snippets), we decided to let Pieces’s code extraction feature shine on its own with its very own web-based utility site.<p.new.line><p id=""><a href="http://codefromscreenshot.com/" target="_blank">Codefromscreenshot.com</a> provides a quick way to use code from screenshots. It can even identify the language of the extracted code! We designed this site to be fast, easy-to-use and ad-free. This is the culmination of 6 months of development work on our very own <a href="http://codefromscreenshot.com/" target="_blank">Runtime.dev</a> web APIs and our machine learning team’s intense work to build OCR models that are fine-tuned to interpret technical language (i.e., code) rather than natural language.<p.new.line><p id="">You may be wondering:<p.new.line><ul id=""><li>Why are people saving or sending screenshots of code in the first place?<li.new.line><li>Can’t I just embed code?<li.new.line><li>Why not use other OCR tools?<li.new.line><ul.new.line><h2 id="">Why are people saving or sending screenshots of code in the first place?<h2.new.line><p id="">The Pieces dev team constantly shares screenshots of code and error traces. &nbsp;We prefer code screenshots in many cases because they preserve text formatting and hence communicate more than just the text.

## Why are people saving or sending screenshots of code in the first place?
