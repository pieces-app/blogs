# The Top 4 Python Back-end Web Frameworks for Your Next Project
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

A website's back-end consists of processes that a user cannot see, such as a server providing data on request and databases that organize information.
A back-end framework has ready-made components for developing the server-side of websites. It consists of libraries that make the development process stress-free and convenient. There are many back-end frameworks that are based on different programming languages such as JavaScript, Python and Ruby.

Python back-end web frameworks, in the same way as Python, have easy-to-read syntax and are object-oriented and scalable. With these frameworks, developers don’t need to worry about low-level details like sockets and protocols.
In this article, four of the top Python back-end web frameworks are introduced, with their features, advantages and disadvantages highlighted as well. The aim of this article is to help you pick a back-end framework for your next web application or website.

## Top 4 Python Back-end Web Frameworks

### Django
<a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Django</a> is the most popular Python web framework for rapid web development. It helps experienced developers save time by allowing them to focus on their website’s content rather than coding from scratch.
- SEO optimized
- Robust template system
- Object-relational mapper
- Automatic admin interface
- Highly scalable and secure
- Rapid development to get an MVP
- Batteries included to avoid coding from scratch
- Large community that can provide answers to questions
- Comprehensive documentation that helps beginners get started
- Has a steep learning curve
- Not good for complex websites
- Lack of a set of principles developers can follow

### Flask
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flask</a> is a micro web framework built with Python. It’s considered a micro web framework because it lacks certain features such as an object-relational mapper.
- URL routing
- Jinja template
- Unicode support
- Integrated unit testing
- Werkzeug WSGI compliance
- Lightweight
- Easily scalable
- Suitable for small projects
- Trouble-free web development
- Fewer tools to work with
- Slower development process to get an MVP
- More complicated maintenance for larger projects

### Cherrypy
<a href="https://docs.cherrypy.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherrypy</a> is a minimalist web framework. It allows developers to build web applications with smaller source codes and less time. It is a microframework as well.
- Built-in server
- Testing support
- CRUD functionality
- MVC and OOP based
- Modular
- Simplicity
- Extendable
- Easily modifiable
- Code reusability (you can save code snippets in <a href="https://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pieces</a>)
- Lack of comprehensive documentation

### TurboGears
<a href="https://turbogears.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TurboGears</a> is another Python web framework that is scalable. It starts as a microframework and can scale up to a full-stack framework.
- ToscaWidgets
- Multi-database support
- Object-relational mapper
- MVC pattern architecture
- Standard WSGI components
- WSGI friendly
- Highly scalable
- Data partitioning support
- Ability to create pluggable applications
- Expansion of the framework can be stressful
- Lack of complete documentation and error messages

## Conclusion
Products are as good as the tools used to build them. By knowing the features, pros and cons of the web frameworks listed above, it’s easier to pick a suitable tool for your next project, whether it’s an MVP, a simple project or a complex project.
