id=""><em id="">Mouses are slow. Keyboards are fast. If you’re a developer, use keyboard shortcuts for programmers to drastically increase your productivity in web browsers, IDEs and code snippet tools like <a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank" id=""><em id="">Pieces for Developers</a><em id="">.

## The Case for Keyboard Shortcuts
id="">According to Brainscape...
id="">‍
id="">A single keystroke may shave "0.4 seconds" from your daily routine, but think about how frequently you reach for your mouse. &nbsp;We're talking hours per week, days per month, weeks per year.
id="">More importantly, <strong id="">keyboard shortcuts keep you in your flow and let you work at the speed of thought**.
id="">With some practice, you’ll be able to quickly perform key tasks and navigate menus in your browser, IDE and tools like <a href="http://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" id="">Pieces for Developers</a> without ever touching that dreaded mouse.


### The Browser

id="">Let’s start with the good ol’ browser, where you’re probably doing a lot of your development research (and checking crypto prices, flicking through YouTubes and I don’t want to know what else).

id="">Vimium — often referred to as the “hacker’s browser” — is a popular <a href="https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb" target="_blank" id="">Chrome extension</a> (with a <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/vimium-ff/" target="_blank" id="">port to Firefox</a>) that allows you to navigate the web using just your keyboard! Shortcuts are based on the <a href="https://www.vim.org/" target="_blank" id="">Vim text editor</a>.
id="">Some power shortcuts in the GIF below include:
- id="">Scrolling up and down (<strong id="">j, k**)
- id="">Switching between tabs (<strong id="">J, K)**

### Developer Workflow Tools

id="">Code snippets are an incredibly helpful way to save time by not re-writing the same code or re-searching for solved solutions. But, it’s always been a hassle to save and work with code snippets.<a href="http://code.pieces.app/" id="">‍</a>
id=""><a href="http://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" id="">Pieces for Developers</a> is a popular new tool that enables you to save code snippets in less than a second from your code editor or any web page in Chrome and Edge.
id="">And as you can guess, Pieces shortcuts are the heart of this beautifully intuitive app.

id="">Just highlight your snippet and click <strong id="">⌥ + ⌘ + P **(Mac) or <strong id="">Ctrl + Alt + P **(Windows).

id="">The Pieces for Developers <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm?hl=en" target="_blank" id="">Chrome extension</a> makes saving code from the internet a breeze.

id="">Highlight the desired code and hit <strong id="">⌘ + Shift + P** (Mac) or <strong id="">Alt + Shift + P** <strong id="">twice** (Windows).Even easier, while this isn’t technically a keyboard shortcut, Pieces pops up a “Save” button when it detects code on a webpage. A single click will save that snippet.

id="">To find a snippet in Pieces for Developers, just hit <strong id="">/** and start searching.
id="">What’s even more helpful is that Pieces for Developers automatically adds the source URL to the snippet as a Related Link. This is one of my favorite features and I no longer have endlessly cluttered Stack Overflow bookmarks with no context.
id="">You can view and manage your related links by hitting <strong id="">⌘** + <strong id="">K** (Mac) or <strong id="">Ctrl** + <strong id="">K** (Windows).

id="">There are loads of other great keyboard shortcuts throughout Pieces. Hover over almost any action and you’ll see a shortcut option.

id="">Some of my favorites include:
- id="">Edit the description: <strong id="">⌘ + N / Ctrl + N**
- id="">Reclassify the snippet language:<strong id=""> ⌘ + Y **/ <strong id="">Ctrl + Y**
- id="">Open the Quick Menu actions: <strong id="">⌘ + O / Ctrl + O**

### Code Editors
id="">When it’s time to get down to coding, the mouse is your enemy. Let’s look at some critical coding keyboard shortcuts for two popular editors:
id=""><a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" id="">VS Code</a> is one of the most popular free code editors, with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode" target="_blank" id="">extensions</a> for all kinds of programming languages and projects. There are dozens of VS Code shortcuts for all sorts of development tasks.

id="">It's only available for Linux machines running <a href="https://www.gnome.org/" target="_blank" id="">Gnome</a> as their desktop environments.
