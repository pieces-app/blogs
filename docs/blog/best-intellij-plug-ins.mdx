id="">Modern developers are looking for an IDE that increases usability and supports diverse plugins. IntelliJ comes bundled with many plugins, such as Maven Helper, Gradle, and Docker, but it also supports tons of other IntelliJ plugins that work seamlessly. So, there is no shortage of choices. In this article, you’ll learn about the 10 best IntelliJ plugins for various development tasks.

## Why Use IntelliJ Plugins?

id="">A plugin is an extension or an add-on from the IntelliJ plugin marketplace that helps developers add features to an existing program. There are many benefits to using plugins, especially when it comes to writing and maintaining code. As developers widely use IntelliJ, the plugins available on the JetBrains Marketplace are extensive and offer a wide variety of options.
id="">There are different types of IntelliJ plugins that can be useful for developers:

- id="">Code versioning plugins
- id="">Debugging plugins
- id="">Collaboration plugins
- id="">Formatting plugins
- id="">User interface plugins
- id="">Custom language support plugins

## Why are the Best IntelliJ Plugins Helpful?<br>
id=""><strong id="">Less time to write code:</strong> While there are many purposes to plugins, most aim to reduce the time it takes to write code. A developer can manage huge projects without manually going through every block of code. For example, some plugins make it easier to search within your code.
id=""><strong id="">Coding assistance through auto-code completion:</strong> Some plugins make suggestions on what comes next based on programming language, among other factors, which programmers can find very helpful. In fact, some AI-based plugins for IntelliJ learn a developer’s way of writing code and make suggestions accordingly. This helps the developer to complete tasks faster.
id=""><strong id="">Debugging assistance: </strong>Some plugins help with debugging code, which improves the overall quality of your project and helps to reduce the time taken to fix any errors.
id=""><strong id="">Easier code analysis:</strong> Plugins can reduce code complexity, which makes analyzing code much easier. Unit testing, for example, can be simplified by analyzing code coverage with plugins like SonarQube.
id=""><strong id="">Accessible code snippet management:</strong> Some of the latest plugins make it easier to manage code snippets so that you can spend less time finding, re-typing or re-searching for code.

## The 10 Best IntelliJ Plugins on the Market
id="">While there’s a wide variety of plugins that developers can use, this article lists some of the best plugins that are supported by IntelliJ. These plugins were chosen based on ease of use, authentic reviews by developers, support for various languages and frameworks, and number of downloads.
