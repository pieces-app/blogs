id="">You’ll learn how to add <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/view/fsGcWz" target="_blank" id="">this cool shader,</a> which kind of resembles the waves in water, but a bit fancier. To create it, follow these steps:
id=""><strong id="">1. Add the umbra_flutter package in your <em id="">pubspec.yaml</em></strong>
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62bb4b4dbf492964b7518103_Umbra%20Flutter.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="A code snippet with and Umbra CLI Comman)
id="">Or add it with the CLI by running:
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62bb4b5e74324d1f2a0fb4cc_Umbra%20Flutter%20CLI.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="A code snippet with an Umbra CLI comman)
id=""><strong id="">2. Create a new shader project with the Umbra CLI by running:</strong>
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62bb4b77a64092178110c64f_Umbra%20Create%20Shader.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="A code snippet with an Umbra CLI command)
id="">‍
id="">This will generate a GLSL file at the root of your project where you can add your GLSL code.
id=""><strong id="">3. Add the following GLSL code to the <em id="">hello_world.glsl</em> file</strong>
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62bb4b9159a5e711d0dd11ae_GLSL%20Hello%20World.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="A code snippet with GLSL shader cod)
id="">‍
id="">As you can see, some of the configurations we saw in the earlier example of the GLSL code are abstracted by Umbra.
id="">The <em id="">main()</em> function is replaced by a <em id="">fragment</em> function which gives us the <em id="">uv</em> (normalized coordinates of the pixel) and <em id="">fragCoord</em> (coordinates of the pixel without <em id="">normalization-gl_FragCoord</em>), and returns the pixel color instead of assigning it to <em id="">gl_FragColor</em>.
id="">We also added another input called <em id="">u_time</em>, which represents the time since we started. It’s crucial when you want to animate your Flutter shaders with respect to time.
id=""><strong id="">4. Create a folder named "shaders" in your lib folder. Now, run the following command, which takes the path of the GLSL shader file and the output location:</strong>
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62bb4bdbe96581b62feee680_Generate%20Dart%20Files%20and%20SPIR-V%20binaries.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="A code snippet with GLSL cod)
id="">This generates the Dart files and the SPIR-V binaries at the given output location for your shader.
id=""><strong id="">5. Create a <em id="">my_shader.dart</em> file somewhere in your lib folder. Add the following code within that file and import your <em id="">HelloWorld</em> shader in this file:</strong>
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62bb868e1654043e10a666d5_Final%20Shader%20Code.png" loading="lazy" width="auto" height="auto" id="" alt="A code snippet with Flutter shader cod)
id="">What you’re doing here, in short, is compiling your shader. As the process is async, you use <em id="">FutureBuilder</em> to load it. Once it’s compiled, you then use the <em id="">.shader()</em> method on your <em id="">UmbraShader</em> object and pass it the required inputs.
id="">The <em id="">resolution</em> is the size you want for your shader, and the <em id="">uTime</em> is the <em id="">delta</em> (time since we started). <em id="">delta</em> is calculated with the help of Ticker. Ticker triggers a callback for every frame that increments the <em id="">delta</em> by 1/60 ms.
id="">Finally, you pass the created Flutter shader to the CustomPainter to paint.
id="">Awesome! You just created your first shader in Flutter! Isn’t that <em id="">exciting?</em>

## Limitations of Flutter Shaders
id="">There are a few limitations and constraints when writing your GLSL shader code for Flutter. Some of the limitations are from Skia, and some are related to the current integration of shaders into Flutter itself.
id="">The following are some of the specific limitations of the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" id="">SPIR-V library</a>:
- id="">It does not support <em id="">while</em> and <em id="">switch</em> statements
- id="">The types that are supported sampler2D, bool, float, float-vector types, and square float-matrix types
- id="">It only uses the built-in functions present in GLSL ES 100
id="">These are some of the limitations/rules mentioned in the <a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank" id="">SPIR-V library</a> that you have to adhere to while writing your GLSL code. Some of these rules are handled by Umbra while generating the raw GLSL code, but for some of them, you should be on the lookout.
id="">In addition, note that there isn’t Flutter web support for shaders at this point. These limitations will likely go away in future versions of the library.
### Next Steps
id="">The initial release for supporting Flutter shaders paves the way for some creative coding and unlocks new and never-before-seen experiences.
id="">While I researched shaders in Flutter, I found some interesting features on the Flutter GitHub that may land in the near future. Some of them add support for compiling your <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/93498#issuecomment-1141271458" target="_blank" id="">GLSL shaders to SPIR-V through the Flutter CLI.</a> There are even proposals that would make it possible to <a href="https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/58361" target="_blank" id="">create custom shaders and ColorFilters with SKSL</a>, which could be extremely useful for image/video editing apps and games in general.
