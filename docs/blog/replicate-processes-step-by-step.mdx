<p id="">Sam is a Machine Learning Engineer who uses Pieces to keep his code consistent over time.<p.new.line><p id="">“I like to save shell commands in Pieces, because in my workflow, I'm usually in the shell at the very start of designing a product, when I'm manipulating data. A lot of these commands I only use once every three or four weeks. An example would be things like commands to shuffle and select data points from a nested directory, or a sequence of commands to set up a cloud instance or push data to it. What I used to have to do was launch on a sort of exploration mission to try and find all the commands again or go through my internet history. Now it's just massively easier.”<p.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-al
