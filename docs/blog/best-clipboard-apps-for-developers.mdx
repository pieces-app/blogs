# Best Clipboard Apps for Developers
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

id="">Both Windows and macOS come with a basic, limited clipboard, which means that you can copy something and then paste it. End users’ needs have evolved in recent years, leading to the creation of more advanced clipboard managers. Not all of these options have been designed with software development in mind, though.
id="">If you have ever felt slowed down by your operating system’s basic clipboard, it is time to try a more powerful app. This article will present the five best clipboard apps for developer productivity, as well as what criteria were used to select them.

## Why You Should Adopt a Clipboard App
id="">As a developer, increasing your productivity should be one of your top priorities. The best clipboard managers offer three ways for you to do that:
- id=""><strong id="">Search through your copied items**: Clipboard managers allow you to easily retrieve the item you want to paste.
- id=""><strong id="">Reuse code snippets**: You can copy all the code snippets you need at once and then paste them only if you need to.

## Elements of a Good Clipboard App
id="">There are specific features to consider when evaluating a clipboard app for developers. The following elements were used to select and rate the top five clipboard managers:
- id=""><strong id="">Cloud support**: The clipboard app should allow you to save your copied items to the cloud so you can access them anywhere, regardless of the device you are using. For security reasons, the app should be able to encrypt the info during upload.
- id=""><strong id="">Custom keyboard shortcuts:** Developers heavily use <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/keyboard-shortcuts-programmers">hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts</a>, and they want the ability to define the shortcuts as needed.
- id=""><strong id="">Multi-format support**: Copying is not always about text. The clipboard manager should also allow you to store multimedia items, such as images, videos, or tables.
- id=""><strong id="">Item organization**: When many items are stored in one place, the storage location can easily become a mess. The manager app should include a clipboard organization system allowing you to organize your copied items or give you the option to quickly find the one you need.

## Top Five Best Clipboard App Managers
id="">The following clipboard manager apps meet the required criteria, so they’ll help you improve your developer productivity as you write software.

##  1. Pieces
