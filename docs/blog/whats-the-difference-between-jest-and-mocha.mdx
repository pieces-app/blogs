# Jest vs Mocha: What’s the Difference?
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p>Jest and Mocha have both become popular testing frameworks among JavaScript developers. Both are open-source test libraries used to validate code in software applications. Both may be used to run JavaScript code tests. However, a closer examination reveals some distinctions between these two testing systems. This article covers the benefits and drawbacks of Jest vs Mocha, enabling you to choose the best one for your project.<p.new.line><h2 id="2fg5u">What are Unit Tests?<h2.new.line><p>Unit testing is a type of software testing in which individual components are tested. The goal is to ensure that each unit of code operates as planned. Therefore, developers perform unit testing throughout an application's development (code phase). It's a good idea to test each program component before going on to the next step. Unit testing is helpful since it’s simple to use and runs rapidly.<p.new.line><p>Unit testing is an essential component of Test-Driven Development (TDD), which is the practice of describing a function's intended behaviors and what we want it to accomplish (or not accomplish) before we begin work on the actual function.

## Jest vs Mocha: A Comprehensive Comparison
The differences between Jest vs Mocha may appear minor at first look, but a few aspects must be considered.
First, Jest was designed to function as a standalone testing framework that does not require further dependencies. Mocha, on the other hand, involves merging some libraries to work effectively. As a result, a developer must define which assertion, mocking, or libraries will be used in the project.
Furthermore, Mocha does not specify any complex prerequisites for linking these libraries together, and is known as a more efficient tool that results in speedier test execution. Again, because Mocha does not impose strict requirements for configuring these libraries, it is a better-optimized tool that may be used more readily and efficiently than similar tools.
Also, Jest has fewer features than Mocha and does not support several essential aspects, such as asynchronous testing. Nevertheless, one of its most enticing aspects is its simplicity. Jest may be a better alternative when a lightweight, uncomplicated testing solution is needed.
Jest is also speedier than Mocha. This is because it has snapshot testing capabilities, which implies that tests are executed automatically whenever the code is changed. This makes it simple to keep tests up to date while working.
Mocha provides more functionality because it is a more developed product with a larger community of contributors.
Let’s take a quick look at this chart:

Above, the trends of both npm modules are shown over time. However, Jest has a far stronger position, with weekly downloads nearly double that of Mocha's. On the other hand, Mocha is marketed as a more reliable and compact solution with fewer issues.
## Which Framework to Use
The fact that Jest comes packaged with a slew of utilities that may or may not be required for work is a turn-off for some people (think about snapshot testing for a backend project). However, for others, having everything in one location without having to go elsewhere for other tools is ideal.
Also, the majority appears to feel that large backend projects can benefit more often from Mocha's flexibility in terms of setup and ad-hoc external library selection. Furthermore, suppose the high speed of running tests is essential. In this case, Mocha's flexibility is considered carefully against the better rate of the Jest runner.
For front-end development, there is general agreement that, while Mocha does an excellent job, aligning with the framework creators' tools is probably a better idea. It can guarantee better and faster updates when new framework releases are made due to better integration with framework-specific tools. React-Testing-Library is a solid illustration of why Jest would be preferable to Mocha in a React project.
Mocha is arguably the best solution if you have a huge project that requires flexibility and customization. Jest is the best alternative if you have a smaller project and don't require the extra setup and configuration upfront. Which framework will be the best answer for you and your team is entirely up to you.
