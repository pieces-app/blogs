Flutter vs React Native: Which is best? Currently, they’re the two most popular frameworks for building cross-platform mobile apps. Facebook and Google, two of the largest tech businesses in the world, support these frameworks.
Presently, there are more than 6 billion mobile users worldwide. When building for mobile, 42% of developers will pick Flutter vs React, according to Statista. Cordova, the third most popular framework, is only selected by 16% of users. Flutter is used by more than 2 million developers, and 500,000 of them do so each month. Although the numbers are incredibly impressive, many of them depend on how popular mobile apps are with users.
## What is React Native?
The Facebook released their mobile programming framework React Native to the public in 2015. Using React Native, developers can create a multi-platform application that works on desktops, mobiles, and the web. React Native lowers the entry level threshold for JavaScript developers by making it comparatively easy to work on cross-platform mobile app development with a codebase written in JavaScript.
## What is Flutter?
Google developed the Flutter cross-platform user interface framework. Since its original release in May 2017, Flutter's popularity has continuously increased. With Flutter, businesses just need to maintain one codebase when developing apps for many platforms. As a result, the amount of time and resources involved in developing and maintaining software is greatly decreased.
## Flutter vs React Native: What’s Different?
When we compare Flutter and React Native, we find that they share many similarities. However, they are quite different in a handful of key ways.
### Programming Language
React Native uses JavaScript as its programming language, which means it transforms JavaScript components into native components. This makes it easy for web developers to adapt quickly in React Native mobile app development.
Flutter uses a language called Dart, which is older and not widely used. Dart has an object-oriented, class-based system.
### Documentation
Both Flutter and React Native have high quality documentation materials. This makes if simple for programmers to develop mobile apps. 
React Native's documentation is a bit messier because it also includes community-developed dependent libraries.
Flutter<strong> </strong>has documentation that is well produced, organized, and comprehensive. In contrast, React Native's documentation requires some explanation.
![](c="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/636526cec7324ea9095ddaa2_image2_2f9e0b62832237918865c204069b25ab_800.p)
### Project Size
Applications built using React Native have a JavaScript runtime environment. Although they often have larger build sizes, Hermes and ProGuard can be enabled in React Native to decrease their size. However, Flutter apps typically have bigger file sizes. Flutter apps' increased build sizes tend to occupy more space.
## Comparison: Flutter vs React Native
Next, we’ll compare Flutter and React Native, explore what makes each framework so special, and discover why they’re so highly sought after. The comparison will be based on the following:
- Performance
- Community
- Flutter vs React Native Trends
- Libraries and Packages
- File Structure
### Performance
It's difficult to say whether a Flutter or a React Native mobile app performs better. There are numerous aspects to take into account, like the type of app, codebase, animations, transitions, app size, layout, data passing, the end user's phone, and more. Therefore, it won't be the same for every app. Both frameworks use hot reloading, which speeds up development by allowing you to see changes immediately.
In contrast, the Dart code used by Flutter is directly translated into C, which is as close to native as you can get. No bridges are necessary for Flutter code to communicate with native code. It’s safe to believe that this would result in improved performance, giving Flutter an edge over React Native. However, React Native recently replaced JavaScript bridges (which communicate with the native code and bridge them, slowing app performance) with JavaScript Interface (JSI) to address performance issues. Without utilizing bridges, JSI enables developers to call the native module directly.
With the help of their developer and user communities, Flutter and React Native both continually enhance their performance. But, overall, Flutter narrowly prevails.
### Community
Both the Flutter and React Native communities are thriving, with numerous conferences, hackathons, and events every year.
It’s impossible to overstate the breadth of the community and available communication avenues where you can interact with professionals and get help with your development-related questions.
Here is a comparison Flutter vs React Native’s most popular communication routes in more detail:
![](c="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/636526cdc7324e3b995dd941_Screenshot2022-11-02at4_50_54PM_66dbc007b59cdece0f0ab89de7e95b93_800.p)
As the table above shows, the Flutter community has expanded more than the React Native community. This is significant since it indicates that more problems are being actively fixed by Flutter developers. By looking at closed GitHub issues, you can get a sense of the speed and attentiveness with which the community handles unresolved issues.

According to Statista's most recent study, Flutter will be the top cross-platform mobile development framework in 2021. React Native falls short of Flutter by 4% (42% versus 38% adoption).

According to the results of a 2022 Stack Overflow Survey, in terms of usage and popularity, Flutter was on the verge of surpassing React Native as of 2021. With a 0.96% edge, React Native was taking precedence over Flutter in 2021:

CIn 2022, Flutter overtook React Native in the popularity contest. This survey shows that Flutter mobile app development now leads.

### File Structure
The code structure here looks extremely familiar if you’ve used React for the web. React Native projects follow the same architecture as React projects:

## When to Apply Flutter vs React Native
Flutter and React Native are both efficient for fast styling and easy <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/building-a-flutter-web-app-from-scratch-a-complete-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mobile app development</a>. However, it’s best to know when to use each framework.
### Use React Native When:
- You want to transition back and forth from a web application to a mobile application and have a single tech stack.
- Your JavaScript team that is knowledgeable about your current assets and utilizes the plug-ins, modules, and widgets from the ```npm``` repository.
- You need to locate a team of React Native engineers quickly (unlike Flutter developers, who are currently harder to find).
### Use Flutter When:
- Financial resources are limited (no need to have multiple teams for native Android and iOS development).
- You have a tight deadline and must quickly deliver a product.
- You want pixel-perfect designs and other <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/accessibility-in-web-development-wai-aria-and-implementation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">elements that make a superb UI</a>.
- Your project requires a cross-platform experience (mobile, desktop, etc.).
## Flutter vs React Native: Who Wins?
There is no clear winner in this contest; both Flutter and React Native have advantages and disadvantages, and the best option relies on your development background as well as the objectives and specifications of your project. It makes sense to write mobile apps in React Native if you’re already familiar with JavaScript. However, you might want to think about giving Flutter a shot if you're hoping for improved performance, stability, and a more harmonious environment amongst ecosystems.
