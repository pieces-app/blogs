## Code snippets are like magic mushrooms

id="">And they‚Äôre everywhere. Open source code, boilerplate code, analytics tags, SQL queries, loops, algorithms, logging and validation and so much more.
id="">Think about how much of this sort of code that you likely write and re-write over and over again. Or how much time you waste trying to find that old snippet in that other project somewhere that will save you time.

## The case for using code snippets
### Save time by not re-writing the same code
id="">Inserting snippets in code saves you from typing duplicative code. Imagine the time wasted searching for how to add an attribute using CSS for multiple elements across your site.

### Eliminate errors
id="">Snippets reduce errors in your code.<strong id=""> </strong>For example, use a snippet to add a consistent event listener across your codebase.
id="">Make your code implementation ready
id="">It‚Äôs frustrating when you forget to save a solution and need it later. Use snippets to save solutions that you typically search for over and over.
### Do better research
id="">Snippets are also great for the research phase of projects as you read articles, take screenshots, scan doc sites and generally want to put a bunch of stuff somewhere that you might need later.
id="">And yet, you probably don‚Äôt save snippets
id="">So why don‚Äôt most devs save snippets?
id=""><em id="">Mostly because it sucks to save snippets.</em>
id="">It takes too long. It breaks your flow. It‚Äôs a pain to name the snippet, label it, put it in a folder.
id="">And if you do battle through this and save lots of snippets‚Ä¶good luck finding it in that flat Notepad or TextEdit doc.
## So we built Pieces for Developers
id="">Basically, we got fed up with these limitations and built our dream code snippet management tool‚Ää‚Äî‚Ää<a href="http://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" id="">Pieces</a>.
id="">It does one thing that is more important than any other thing:
id="">You can save snippets in less than a second, straight from your editor or browser.‚Äç

id="">Pieces offers a bunch of other super useful features:
- id="">Auto-categorizes snippets by language
- id="">Auto-tags the snippet with the things inside it like for loops or switch statements.
- id="">Auto-captures the project and file name and line numbers that the snippet came from in your editor
- id="">Stores the URL that the snippet came from if you saved from a web page like StackOverflow
- id="">Enables you to manually save related links to a snippet
id="">All of this serves one critical purpose:
