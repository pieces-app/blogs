<p id="">Machine Learning Engineer Patryk doesn’t spend a lot of time coding; programming is actually a very small percentage of each of his tasks. But, Pieces has proved useful in his workflow as he trains new ML models and researches solutions to challenging problems.<p.new.line><p id="">“When it comes to an actual problem that I want to solve, before I come up with my own idea, I'm trying to figure out how people solve similar issues, and I'm trying to save all of the possible machine learning models that come out of that research. So, I’m saving the models to Pieces, comparing them later, and then coming up with my own idea or maybe just reusing some of the solutions that were used before.”<p.new.line><p id="">Patr
