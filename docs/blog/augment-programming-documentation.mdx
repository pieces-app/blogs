> Let's say I'm searching for code online. Maybe the article wasn't well written or the documentation isn't all that great, because, let's be honest, the programming documentation out there isn’t always that great,”

says Moon.

> “It's really helpful to just copy and paste a piece of code into Pieces and get a more definitive answer as to what the language is, what the related links and tags are, and other stuff that Pieces generates to get more context about the code. Sometimes I don't want to read all the documentation. I just want quick, short, simple answers as to what this thing does.”
