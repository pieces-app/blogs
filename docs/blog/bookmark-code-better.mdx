# A Better Way to Bookmark Code as a Developer

id="">I’m sure most of you search Google to find solutions for errors, from how to sort a list to a breadth-first binary tree traversal to how to establish a database connection.
id="">Chances are, you bookmark code solutions from some StackOverflow page, thinking it’s saved for the future.
id="">But revisiting that solution in your bookmarks folder is suboptimal for a bunch of reasons:

- Maybe you spend a bunch of effort organizing bookmarks, but most of us don’t have time.
- A bookmark provides minimal information unless you click through each link.
- Bookmarks save no context for your problem, which is often how you might want to search.

id="">Fear not - let’s look at a simple, free bookmarking tool (and WAY more), Pieces for Developers. It’s much more effective at managing your saved links and solutions.
id="">A much more effective way to bookmark code
id="">You might know Pieces for Developers as a snippet tool where you can save code and easily find, reuse, or reference it later. One of the more interesting ways I use Pieces is through the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pieces-save-code-snippets/igbgibhbfonhmjlechmeefimncpekepm" target="_blank">Chrome extension</a>, which enables me to save code from any webpage with one click.
id="">The most killer feature of the Pieces for Chrome extension, though, is Related Links. This makes it far more useful as a home for your URLs. &nbsp;When you save a snippet from a web page using the extension, Pieces automatically saves the URL of the page the snippet came from.
id="">So when you need that snippet, you can search in Pieces using exact or fuzzy match based on the snippet or the language, and you’ll also find a link to the URL that you originally got the snippet from. THAT is incredibly helpful to refresh on the context around the snippet. Way more helpful than a quickly bookmarked code snippet!

## Let’s look at some examples in the wild...
### Finding Shell Commands

id="">If you’ve ever tried bookmarking your dev shell commands, you know it’s much easier to just search for them again than find them in your bookmarks list.

- Try to remember what the page was
- Scroll through an endless list 
- Finally find the link and navigate to it<strong id="">‍‍</strong>

id="">1. Search for the saved snippet
id="">2. Navigate to its related links

### Saving Git Commands
id="">Git commands are super handy. Maybe you’ve tried bookmarking commands to merge your local branch, fetch, rebase, or resolve conflicts for your ease, but forgot your way back.
id="">If you’d saved those commands in Pieces for Developers, you can get right back to your page in no time using the Related Links feature.

### Frontend Development
id="">While working with CSS, you might get confused about when to use an inline, block, or inline-block display for controlling the layout of an element. Scrolling through a never-ending list of code bookmarks to find their correct usage on W3Schools is a nightmare, isn’t it? Instead, you can simply save a snippet in Pieces and jump to the relevant pages to understand their use cases. Don’t bookmark code; find the right snippet and use it in no time.
