<p id=""><em id="">üí° Trying to bookmark code in your browser is pretty painful when you want to find and revisit that solution later.

## Let‚Äôs look at some examples in the wild...
### Finding Shell Commands
id="">If you‚Äôve ever tried bookmarking your dev shell commands, you know it‚Äôs much easier to just search for them again than find them in your bookmarks list.
- Try to remember what the page was
- Scroll through an endless list 
- Finally find the link and navigate to it<strong id="">‚Äç‚Äç</strong>

### Saving Git Commands 
id="">Git commands are super handy. Maybe you‚Äôve tried bookmarking commands to merge your local branch, fetch, rebase, or resolve conflicts for your ease, but forgot your way back.
