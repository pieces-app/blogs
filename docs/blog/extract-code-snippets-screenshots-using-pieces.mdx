Developers take a ton of screenshots of code which often live on their desktop or in some Finder tray. &nbsp;These screenshots are usually impossible to search and the code in the image isn’t accessible. But with the Pieces snippet saving tool, images can now be converted into text so that the code inside the screenshots can be copied, pasted, and edited in your IDE.

✋<strong>Raise your hand if you’ve experienced these screenshot frustrations:</strong>
- You face an issue while coding. A quick Google search gets you to a useful tutorial with it, so you take a screenshot and later retype the code into your editor manually.
- You’re on Reddit and find a screenshot of useful code but you need to screenshot it or bookmark the page and now it’s effectively gone from your memory.
- You see someone asking for help on a StackOverflow or FreeCodeCamp and want to try running their code, which turns out to be a screenshot.
- You’re trying to follow a beginner’s guide to a new tech you’ve been wanting to learn, but you can’t easily copy the example code from the screenshots.
- You struggle with searching text in screenshots
The common thread above is that screenshots with code aren’t searchable on your desktop and you can’t extract the code from inside the image.
<a href="http://pieces.app/">Pieces</a> is a snippet-saving tool that performs magic on screenshots. &nbsp;You can upload your screenshot to Pieces and automatically turn it into an usable snippet.

And better yet - your screenshots become fully searchable based on the text inside them. &nbsp;Because let’s face it - you like have hundreds or thousands of screenshots sitting on your desktop and you have little to no way to search through them. &nbsp;So now you can search your screenshots based on:
- Any keyword inside the screenshot
- The code classification of the snippet inside the screenshot - i.e. all your Javascript screenshots
- Structures inside your code - i.e. for loops or switch statements
