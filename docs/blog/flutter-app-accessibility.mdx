# Improve App Accessibility in Flutter for Better User Experience

<p id="">When you finish building the first version of an app, it can be exciting to release it to the public and let people start using it. But, if you haven't properly implemented the principles of app accessibility, some people may not be able to use your app the way you intended them to.<p.new.line><p id="">Enter Accessibility (A11y)! Many developers ignore it, some are even unaware of it, but app accessibility is as important as any other feature.

This can make it challenging to carry out daily tasks and perform actions that others often take for granted. In our context as Flutter developers, we want to make sure that everyone can interact with digital services, apps, <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/build-a-pong-game-in-flutter-with-flame" target="_blank" id="">games</a>, etc.<p.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6425dabc49f020abc816200a_62fbc4cb2c32732a027bfe04_1_tchgEbp8Wjbgr8EEtj2MzA.png" loading="lazy" alt="A grid of disabilities that read: vision, hearing loss, cognitive, neurological, mobility, and motor impairment."><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p id="">‍<p.new.line><p id=""><a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/accessibility-in-web-development-wai-aria-and-implementation" target="_blank" id="">Building accessible apps</a> should be one your main goals.

They often rely on screen readers or enlarging the text with the accessibility options on their devices. Be aware of this <strong id="">text scale factor</strong> to make sure that the text within your app scales properly based on accessibility settings.<p.new.line><p id="">In Flutter app development, if you’re using a <em id="">Text</em> widget to display text, then the changing text size calculations are handled by the widget itself. It has a <em id="">textScaleFactor</em> property which is multiplied by the set/default font size to calculate the text's new font size.<p.new.line><p id="">The Flutter <em id="">textScaleFactor</em> is obtained from the <em id="">MediaQuery.of(context).textScaleFactor</em>, which represents the <em id="">textscaleFactor</em> set by the underlying operating system or user through accessibility options. By default, it’s <strong id="">1.0</strong>.<p.new.line><p id="">For example, if the <em id="">textscaleFactor</em> is 1.5, the text will be 50% larger than the specified font size.<p.new.line><p id="">Note that if you’re using a <em id="">RichText</em> Flutter widget, it won't support automatic text scaling.

In such cases, you can add your own semantics to suit your needs. Flutter provides us with several accessibility widgets that can help us to build more accessible apps.<p.new.line><p id="">One of those widgets is <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html" target="_blank" id="">Semantics</a>. It allows you to add custom semantics to your Flutter widgets by providing you with various options to provide a description of a widget, its content, and whether it’s a button, slider, or other action component that a user can interact with. Also, you can describe the specific action that takes place if you double-tap, long press, or perform any other gestures on the component.<p.new.line><p id="">There’s a lot more to semantics than just the Semantics widget, including <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MergeSemantics-class.html" target="_blank" id=""><em id="">MergeSemantics</em></a> and <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ExcludeSemantics-class.html" target="_blank" id=""><em id="">ExcludeSemantics</em><strong id="">,</strong></a> which can be helpful in various scenarios.

id="">People with some forms of vision impairments may access your app with screen readers. Screen readers provide spoken feedback so that people can use their devices without looking at their screens.
id="">Based on a user's gestures or through external controllers like a keyboard, screen readers narrate the semantics of the components, say whether something is tappable or not, and then dictate the results of those actions and other information that may help the user navigate through your app.
id="">On Android, we have a screen reader called TalkBack. On iOS, we have VoiceOver; similar screen readers are available for other operating systems. People can enable them through the accessibility options on their devices.
id="">By default, most Flutter widgets have some semantics. Flutter is smart enough to update those default semantics based on the data you pass to the required parameters of those widgets.
id="">Let’s look at the following example where we navigate through a Flutter counter app with the help of Android's screen reader.

id="">When the app is first opened with the screen reader, it reads the title in the <em id="">AppBar.</em> As we tap different parts of the app, it gives feedback on the tapped component.
id="">The default results are usually fine, but sometimes the default semantics won’t be able to provide a user with the proper information. In such cases, you can add your own semantics to suit your needs. Flutter provides us with several accessibility widgets that can help us to build more accessible apps.
id="">One of those widgets is <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/Semantics-class.html" target="_blank" id="">Semantics</a>. It allows you to add custom semantics to your Flutter widgets by providing you with various options to provide a description of a widget, its content, and whether it’s a button, slider, or other action component that a user can interact with. Also, you can describe the specific action that takes place if you double-tap, long press, or perform any other gestures on the component.
id="">There’s a lot more to semantics than just the Semantics widget, including <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/MergeSemantics-class.html" target="_blank" id=""><em id="">MergeSemantics</em></a> and <a href="https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ExcludeSemantics-class.html" target="_blank" id=""><em id="">ExcludeSemantics</em><strong id="">,</strong></a> which can be helpful in various scenarios. If you want to learn more about the best practices, ways you can use them, or dig a little deeper into the underlying workings of <a href="https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/07/semantics/" target="_blank" id="">Semantics In Flutter</a>, which we haven’t covered here, check out some of the links to the learning materials I mention at the end of this article.
### On App Accessibility: A Note to Developers
id="">Proper app accessibility should never be an optional task. The things some people take for granted can be difficult to achieve for others, and making sure that everyone can enjoy your apps and games is your responsibility as a developer.
id="">Most of the time, we don’t even realize that there are people who are missing out on these experiences and totally neglect the users who would be enjoying your apps if you’d only learned how to make an app accessible.
id="">Adding accessibility options takes more time and effort, but it’s something we can’t neglect. Many people depend on these digital solutions, and a developer's efforts can go a long way toward being truly helpful. You can always start small by improving things in your apps, gradually making them more accessible.
## Summary
id="">We discussed some common app accessibility problems and how you can make your Flutter apps more accessible by considering accessibility solutions.
id="">There’s far more to accessibility apps than what we discussed. I’ve shared some links below, which I think you should definitely take the time to explore. They go more in-depth on app accessibility in general and Flutter accessibility in particular. Building accessibility awareness can only make you a better developer and give your apps a wider audience with better UX.
id="">Thanks for reading this article! If you found it helpful, please don’t forget to share it with other devs.
