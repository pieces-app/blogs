## ​​​What is a Backend Database?
​​A backend database is where data is kept to be accessed by users via separate applications. Essentially, data is stored in one application, and users can call on that data through a separate app. In this article, you’ll learn the details of five different backend database tools along with their pros and cons so that you can better understand how they can be utilized.
## Backend Database Tools
<strong>​​</strong>Now that we know what a backend database is and what it does, let's look at some databases to get you started on your journey to becoming a better backend developer.
### ​​MySQL
<a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MySQL</a> is an open-source database management system that’s easily recognizable and broadly utilized for web-based applications. It’s fast, and it performs at a high level. MySQL is rated highly for its quality, scalability, and usability. Also quite reliable, MySQL works seamlessly when paired with several other platforms. Also, it has noteworthy classification support, and its data security is strong in addition to several other features. MySQL boasts a wide range of prominent operating systems (OS) and high compatibility with some of the most well-known programming languages, including Java and PHP.
Now that we fully understand MySQL and what it does, let's look at a few of its pros:
- <strong>Organized: </strong>As a relative database management system or RDBMS, MySQL stores and presents data in easily understandable tabular forms organized in rows and columns.
- <strong>Secure:</strong> MySQL has a solid data security layer that protects sensitive information from intruders. Passwords on MySQL are encrypted.
- <strong>Open-source:</strong> As an open-source database management system, MySQL is available for free download directly from the official site.
- <strong>Widely Compatible:</strong> MySQL works well with most operating systems, like Windows, MacOS, Linux, Netware, and Solaris.
- <strong>Flexible:</strong> MySQL is very flexible, and it supports a large number of embedded apps.
Although there are many advantages to this database, here are some of its drawbacks:
- <strong>Limited Capacity:</strong> MySQL does not handle large databases well.
- <strong>Weak Tools: </strong>Compared to some paid databases, the open-source MySQL has an inferior developing and debugging tool.
- <strong>Vulnerable:</strong> MySQL can be prone to data corruption due to its inefficiency when handling transactions.
- <strong>No Check Constraints:</strong> MySQL does not support SQL check constraints.
I've learned that it usually helps users to look at the caliber of its big-name users to determine the quality of a product. Here are some notable users of MySQL:
- <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google</a>
- <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NASA</a>

<a href="https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MongoDB</a> is a free, popular, open-source database, and it’s highly sought after by developers. This NoSQL database utilizes JSON-styled documents with selective schemas for storing and retrieving data. It also creates an attractive means of scalability and flexibility. MongoDB offers outstanding features like file storage, load balancing, transactions, and aggregation. As a bonus, when it comes to MongoDB’s security and data retrieval, it’s superior to other database management systems. MongoDB also boasts a wide range of compatibility with well-known programming languages like Python, Java, C/C++, etc.
We've covered a brief overview of MongoDB. Now, let's look at some of the pros of using it:
- <strong>Fast:</strong> Due to its document-oriented nature, MongoDB offers its users high speed and performance.
- <strong>Flexible:</strong> MongoDB is a flexible, NoSQL database system, which makes it suitable for both structured and unstructured data. It's also schema-less, meaning users can store any type of data they want.
- <strong>Convenient Support:</strong> MongoDB gives its users access to professional technical support. If you run into issues, an expert is waiting for you to reach out.
- <strong>Ad-hoc Queries:</strong> MongoDB supports ad-hoc queries. It allows for on-the-spot ad-hoc query updates.
- <strong>Sharding:</strong> With MongoDB sharding, users don't have to worry about the server struggling with large data sets. Sharding allows data to be divided between multiple servers for processing while normal activities progress smoothly.
Despite the above-listed pros, MongoDB might not be for every user. Here are a few reasons why:
- <strong>Dependent on Index Quality:</strong> MongoDB relies heavily on good indexes. This means that incorrectly implemented indexes can drastically impact its speed or performance negatively.
- <strong>Data Duplication:</strong> The duplication of data is an issue.
- <strong>Heavy Space and Memory Demands:</strong> MongoDB takes up a lot of space and uses a lot of memory.
- <strong>Data Size Limit:</strong> With MongoDB, your data size is limited to a measly 16MB. On top of that, documents can’t be nested in more than 100 levels. However, that could change with the release of future updates.
Here are some notable users of MongoDB:
- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toyota</a>
- <a href="https://flobiz.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flobiz</a>

<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PostgreSQL</a> is one of the most high-level, multipurpose, object-relational database management systems. It’s open source, which means that its source code is easily accessible under the PostgreSQL license. Therefore, anyone with the right skills can freely utilize, alter, and distribute it in any form. All in all, PostgreSQL is highly stable, and little effort is needed to maintain this database.
Present-day databases like MySQL and Hive operate similarly in establishing relationships among data. However, PostgreSQL offers a bit more in table inheritance and function overloading as it supports the idea of data objects.
Continuing with the structure of this article, here are some pros of utilizing PostgreSQL:
- <strong>Open Source: </strong>PostgreSQL’s source code is made available for free under an open-source agreement. Because of this, businesses can utilize and even modify it to suit their needs.
- <strong>Simple:</strong> PostgreSQL is easy to use. New users don't need much training to learn it from scratch.
- <strong>Low Maintenance:</strong> PostgreSQL has low maintenance and administration needs for both enterprise use and embedded use.
- <strong>Tolerant:</strong> It’s very tolerant of faults due to its write-ahead logging.
- <strong>Available:</strong> PostgreSQL has great availability.
Now, we understand PostgreSQL some of its benefits. However, what are some of the things that could deter users from choosing PostgreSQL? Here are some of its drawbacks:
- <strong>Low Awareness:</strong> PostgreSQL does not belong solely to any organization, and it has had some trouble with awareness despite all of its features.
- <strong>Relatively Slow:</strong> PostgreSQL is slower than some of its competitors.
- <strong>Limited Compatibility:</strong> PostgreSQL is not as supported by a lot of open-source apps as some of its competitors are.
- <strong>Time-Consuming to Alter:</strong> If changes need to occur for better speed on PostgreSQL, it usually takes more effort than it would on some of its competitors.
PostgreSQL also boasts an impressive lineup of notable users:
