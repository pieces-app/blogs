## The Top 8 Differences Between AWS and GCP
AWS and GCP are two of the three top competitors in the field of cloud computing (the third is <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Azure</a>). They share a few similarities, each with at least a hundred products and services in their catalog. All of these services effectively aid customers working with cloud technologies. However, AWS and GCP also have several notable differences.
Let’s look at a detailed comparison of some of their most popular products and services:
### 1. Kubernetes
<a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a> (K8s) is a free system that helps to automatically deploy, manage, scale, and orchestrate container apps. Container apps are resources that help run code and its component dependencies.
Kubernetes manages containers and even makes them more portable while providing users with the best possible utilization of resources for app development. Here’s how these two cloud technologies compare in this regard:
- GCP makes it easier to run Kubernetes as Google has been prominent in developing Kubernetes from its infancy.
- Elastic Kubernetes services for AWS do not give users access to resource monitoring tools, unlike GCP’s Stackdriver.
### 2. Storage
Amazon and Google have different ways of tackling cloud storage. To map out the difference between the two, let’s look at their features.
- Individual items get stored in separate buckets. To retrieve these buckets, the developer gives keys to access them.
- An <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS S3</a> bucket is storable, but it depends on factors like availability, proximity, issues with cost relation, and latency. AWS boasts of a large web of interconnected data centers globally. This means higher performance and quicker response times when storing and retrieving data across long distances.
- With GCP storage, users can expect a high level of availability.
- There is consistency of data across various regions and locations.
- Users have access to Google developer console projects.
### 3. Computation
GCP Compute Engine is a host-and-compute service that enables users to scale virtual machines while running workload apps and tasks.
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides users with secure, resizable computing in the cloud. It also offers a variety of options for processors, storage, OS, networking, and purchase models.
Now, let’s look at the instances provided by both companies to note their differences.
- Memory Optimized: Providing up to 12TB of space, GCP compute engine is for tasks that are memory intensive.
- General Purpose: Directed at general workloads, it provides fair price and performance ratios.
- Accelerator Optimized: GCP is designed for <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/what-is-gpu-computing-used-for#:~:text=Generally%2C%20GPUs%20are%20used%20to,cores%20and%20superior%20memory%20bandwidth." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPU-intensive processes</a> and <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchdatacenter/definition/parallel-processing?amp=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parallel processing</a>.
- Compute Optimized: It offers higher performance than the general purpose instance. In addition, it is suitable for compute-intensive workloads.
- Storage Optimized Instances: In AWS EC2, storage optimized instances are for workloads that perform read/write for data stored locally in large amounts.
- General Purpose Instances: General purpose instances work best for web servers and provide equal proportions of different functionalities such as computing and networking.
- GPU/Accelerated Instances: These require extra processors and GPUs to boost hardware performances. AWS EC2 GPU/accelerated instances are for graphics processing and floating-point calculation in need of an enormous amount of processing power.
- Compute Optimized Instances: These instances function best when they get utilized for high-performance tasks that demand high-speed processors and are compute-intensive. With AWS EC2, compute optimized instances are for tasks like devices, game servers, and media encoding.
- Memory Optimized Instances: These get powered by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/nitro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Nitro System</a> and are brought to <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-optimized.html#:~:text=EBS%20optimized%20by%20default&amp;text=*%20These%20instances%20can%20support%20maximum,select%20one%20of%20these%20instances." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EBS optimized instances</a>. They can best serve you when you require a large amount of data to get processed in the memory.
### 4. Cloud Functions
Serverless computing is a widespread FaaS instance that does not need virtual machine instances before use.  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS Lambda</a> is the AWS answer to serverless offerings, while Cloud Functions is GCP’s answer.
- Google Cloud Functions only work with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a>, whereas AWS Lambda supports various languages like C, Python, and Java.
- GCP’s Cloud Functions are easier to run than AWS Lambda. However, AWS Lambda has a speed advantage.
### 5. Availability
Availability zones should be considered when choosing your Cloud Platform. GCP and AWS offer a wide range of availability in several zones, but what’s the difference?
- GCP: Google Cloud Platform offers its services in 35 different regions worldwide, along with 106 zones, and is <a href="https://cloud.google.com/about/locations" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">available</a> in over 200 countries. In addition, GCP has nine areas currently under development, meaning GCP could be available in 44 regions by the year 2024.
- AWS: AWS spans 87 zones within 27 regions and has announced plans for 24 more <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Availability Zones</a>. AWS has a leg up over GCP as it is available in many more countries around the globe.
### 6. Machine Learning
AWS and GCP present users with top-tier machine-learning tools that help train, develop, and test a machine-learning model.
- AWS has three high-quality tools: <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Lex</a>, <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/rekognition/latest/dg/what-is.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon Rekognition</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/pm/sagemaker/?trk=cd28e1b7-319b-4ddb-ac47-5cd3db3627fb&amp;sc_channel=ps&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!537695327234!e!!g!!amazon%20sagemaker&amp;ef_id=CjwKCAjwh4ObBhAzEiwAHzZYU1ZsWn0eN9HWgWkqa4uFVWLmE7PhBWrFaIv_YnNwvdFDQXTDXj12qxoCpiEQAvD_BwE:G:s&amp;s_kwcid=AL!4422!3!537695327234!e!!g!!amazon%20sagemaker" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon SageMaker</a>.
- GCP, on the other hand, offers two top options: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/automl" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud AutoML</a>, for beginners, and <a href="https://medium.com/crossml/google-cloud-platform-gcp-for-machine-learning-ai-36165b1767b0#:~:text=AI%20Platform%20integrated%20with%20several,training%20using%20Data%20Labeling%20Service." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine</a>, for handling tasking projects. GCP also provides <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwh4ObBhAzEiwAHzZYU4_1SsY5AoksaT-JWI-OocLYwHn-WivsoiWJh-fRwv6Hj2PlGDYKZhoCcMgQAvD_BwE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tenserflow</a> and <a href="https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=emea-ng-all-en-dr-skws-all-all-trial-e-gcp-1011340&amp;utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_m-CRE_574561877919-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+SKWS+-+EXA+%7C+Txt+~++AI+%26+ML+~+Vertex+AI-KWID_43700072745609391-aud-606988878414:kwd-553582750299-userloc_1010297&amp;utm_term=KW_vertex%20ai-NET_g-PLAC_&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwh4ObBhAzEiwAHzZYU5NuMThn_WpLrsjSu0doJvAg502s9eOM-SVYGd0Pe6bvw9GhdCAevxoCVsgQAvD_BwE&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vertex AI </a>complicated machine learning abilities.
### 7. Age
The most simple comparison between AWS and GCP is their age difference, with AWS beating out GCP by two years. AWS cloud-computing was released in 2006, and GCP was launched in 2008. This gives AWS the upper hand as they had two years without competition in the market.
