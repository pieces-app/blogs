## What is Pieces?
id="">Pieces is the fastest, smartest AI Assistant for snippets. We're enabling developers to automatically or manually save useful code snippets, extract code from screenshots, auto-complete code and more.

### Understanding our Stack
id="">In order to understand how we use Pieces to build Pieces, it’s helpful to review our tech stack.

## Pieces + Flutter = &lt;3&nbsp;
id="">While building the Pieces app with Flutter and Dart, our team found many valuable use cases for saving snippets in the Pieces app to improve our productivity. Let’s review some of them.&nbsp;
### Saving &amp; Reusing Widgets
