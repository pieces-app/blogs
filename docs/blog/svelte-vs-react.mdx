## What is Svelte?

The Svelte framework is a free, <u><a href="https://opensource.com/resources/what-open-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">open-source</a></u> frontend framework. Initially released in 2016, the first stable version was released in 2022. Svelte is a JavaScript framework for making interactive web pages and web apps.
Like many <u><a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/the-top-3-javascript-front-end-frameworks-in-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other JavaScript frameworks</a></u>, Svelte increases the efficiency of web development. It has certain features that make it stand out, which we’ll discuss later in this article.
## What is React?

React has been around for a long time now. Facebook created React, a widely used JavaScript framework, in 2011, and open-sourced it in 2013.
In addition to being open-source, React is popular because it can be used for both simple and complex single-page apps and to build incredible interactive user interfaces.
Multiple factors make Svelte and React comparable. Each programmer has their own reasons for choosing one over the other. Let’s figure out which team you’re on.
## Svelte vs React: A Point-by-Point Comparison
### Performance
One major component of framework performance is the Traditional Document Object Model (<u><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction#:~:text=content%20and%20applications.-,What%20is%20the%20DOM%3F,can%20interact%20with%20the%20page." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DOM</a></u>). This pushes an update whenever code changes, and as a result, an app’s performance slows down. Because of this, we need <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/understanding-dom-and-virtual-dom-and-how-they-work-with-react" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Document Object Model</a> (<u><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html#:~:text=The%20virtual%20DOM%20(VDOM)%20is,This%20process%20is%20called%20reconciliation." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VDOM</a></u>). VDOM acts as temporary memory storage for changes to the user interface, and as a result, the app performs more quickly. Through diffusion, updates are delayed until rendering and updating can be carried out.
Svelte works as a compiler that performs DOM rendering through <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/reactive-programming#:~:text=Reactive%20programming%20describes%20a%20design,a%20user%20makes%20an%20inquiry." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reactive programming</a>, making it server-first programming (if you’re building an app, it directly converts it into JavaScript code). Because of this, the DOM updates whenever an action changes the component stage.
React, on the other hand, breaks down an app’s code with Virtual DOM.
Comparing both frameworks by performance, Svelte has the advantage because it ignores the React Virtual DOM breakdown process, making it very fast and responsive.
### Learning Difficulty
Is Svelte easier than React? Simple <u><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTML</a></u>, <u><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript</a></u> make up Svelte, so yes, it’s easier to use than React. Also, Svelte works with basic JavaScript web development models and provides select HTML extensions to facilitate learning.
Despite being a more popular framework, React is difficult to learn. It requires knowledge of complex components (<u><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSX_(JavaScript)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JSX</a></u>, CSS-in-JS) to build the simplest applications.
So, without a doubt, Svelte wins this round.
### Use
Since Svelte has less complicated code, building websites and apps with it is easier. Svelte improves load and render time. Therefore, we can say that Svelte is best for beginners.
React, on the other hand, has a very solid foundation and community. Large companies including Facebook use React, and it has endless amounts of resources.
### Tools and Library
By now, it’s embedded in our minds that Svelte is a newer framework. Because of this, it has lightweight libraries. Therefore, to create bigger or more complex applications, intermediary or external apps might be necessary.
Because it’s widely used, there are a <u><a href="https://blog.bitsrc.io/11-top-react-developer-tools-for-2020-3860f734030b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">variety of React tools</a></u> and <u><a href="https://reactlibraries.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">libraries</a></u>. Development is faster because of its extensive component libraries.
### Community
Svelte is new, so it doesn’t have a large community. But, it’s still growing, so it’s bound to have a large community in the future.
In contrast, the React community is already robust, giving you an abundance of resources and needed help.
### Syntax
Remember how Svelte is easier to learn? This is because of its simple syntax. Svelte code is easier to read because it uses JavaScript classes rather than JavaScript functions.
On the other hand, React’s syntax is complex. This is partially because it’s a combination of HTML and JavaScript code, and partially because the syntax for React is JSX, which is very difficult to understand.
### Documentation
Svelte documentation isn’t as comprehensive as React’s because it is relatively new. React has extensive documentation as a result of its large community.
### User Interface
In Svelte, user interfaces are built in the <u><a href="https://dev.to/joshnuss/svelte-compiler-under-the-hood-4j20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">compiling stage</a></u>. In React, the interfaces are built in the <u><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript_engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript engine</a></u> of a web browser.
### Testing Framework
The Svelte testing library carries out individual testing. In addition to its small size, its library’s data processing is less complicated.
React gives you <u><a href="https://www.testim.io/blog/react-end-to-end-testing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">end-to-end tests</a></u> for your complete apps, and this is most helpful because it reduces marketing time and increases value.
### Code Maintenance
Svelte gives you smooth, readable code. When there are a lot of components to be defined, well-structured code eases the work.
React is perfect for teamwork. Because it allows you to use different parts of your code for separate projects, thus saving time and effort.
Svelte doesn’t allow you to reuse code, but with React, you can reuse components.
## When to Use Svelte
Svelte is mostly used for:
- Individual web pages
- Building applications with limited data connection
- Interactive visuals
## When to Use React
You can use React to build:
- Web applications
- Desktop applications
- Mobile applications
- <u><a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/best-jamstack-frameworks-for-developing-static-and-dynamic-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JAMstack</a></u> sites
- Media sites
- Video streams
## Svelte vs React: Final Thoughts
So, what’s the verdict? We have to admit that the rumor about Svelte is true; it is comparable to React. But, is it better?
Svelte is an amazing framework. It’s easy to learn and very fast, among many other brilliant features. A lot of developers have switched to Svelte, and as it continues to grow, it will likely get even more popular.
Nonetheless, React is an old, trusted, well-established framework, used by many developers and corporations around the world. React has a large community and is perfect for experienced users.
