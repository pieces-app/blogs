## Google’s AI upgrades to Docs &amp; Gmail with Bard
Google has been investing heavily in AI for several years and has recently announced their new language model, Bard. Although, the full capabilities of Bard are still being tested, early signs suggest that it has enormous potential. This means it will likely go head-to-head with OpenAI. Similar to the autocomplete capabilities found in the Microsoft M365 ecosystem, Bard is expected to make it possible for G suite tools like Slides, Docs, Sheets, and G chat to generate presentations, create visualizations of data with just one click, and introduce new features that streamline workflows and enhance productivity. 
Google has also been investing heavily in AI startups. They have put <u><a href="https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/google-invests-300m-to-compete-with-chatgpt-claude-by-anthropic-efd0f0e1222" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$300 million into Anthropic</a>,</u> the creators of Claude, a LLM looking to compete with ChatGPT. Claude is not yet available to the public, so very few know the true capabilities of AI. Their large valuation, $3 billion after Google’s investment, aligns well with Sequoia’s predictions about the future investment opportunities in generative AI and developer tools 2.0. 
With Bard’s rollout and Google’s investments in startups, Google is demonstrating its commitment to implementing AI to revolutionize the way users work, communicate, and collaborate.
