You could already save snippets using a "Save to Pieces" command prompt or by using keyboard shortcuts, but this release allowed you to hover over the snippet's name in order to preview it. With Tree View, all of the snippets became organized based on their language. To use a saved snippet, you simply had to click on it in the Tree View.
