# Should You Use Redux With NextJS?

<p id="">Redux is a great choice for state management in React applications, but it has received its fair share of criticism as well.

id="">Today, I will try to answer the question of should we use Redux in NextJS and show you some alternative ways of doing things that you might want to consider.
## My Direct Answer
id="">If you want my direct opinion on this topic, <em id="">you should really, really try to avoid using Redux in NextJS. It's not a nextJs best practice arguably.</em>
id="">Let me explain why.
### Reason 1: NextJS Architecture Is Not Suitable for Redux.
id="">The general architecture of a NextJS application is usually very different from a ReactJS application.
id="">In NextJS, we have the concepts of <em id="">getServerSideProps</em> and <em id="">getStaticProps</em> which can populate the data required for a page before rendering. So, using Redux in NextJS often doesn’t make that much sense.
### Reason 2: Redux Has Other Alternatives.
id="">React now supports <em id="">Context</em>, which can share common states between components.
id="">If you have a lot of nested components that need a shared piece of data, then you can just use<em id=""> React Context</em>. Like the following:
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62da88006734e50ded5e6fef_React%20Context.png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A React code snippe)
id="">In fact, there are many scenarios where you wouldn’t even need any centralized state management solution. I will go over some of those scenarios in this article!
### <strong id="">Reason 3: It’s Very, </strong>Very<strong id=""> Complex to Set Up.</strong>
id="">If you still feel that you need Redux in your NextJS application, just a heads up...it’s really complex to set up Redux with NextJS. 
id="">You will need a special package named <a href="https://github.com/kirill-konshin/next-redux-wrapper" target="_blank" id="">next-redux-wrapper</a> to get it to work. Even after that, handling the server and client states and making them sync is a lot of pain. Read more about that <a href="https://github.com/kirill-konshin/next-redux-wrapper" target="_blank" id="">here.</a>
### Reason 4: Optimizing Redux in NextJS is Complex.
id="">Even after all of these, if you managed to integrate Redux with NextJS, the next problem you will face is performance.
id="">One big argument against React Context is its performance implications and using Redux can sometimes solve that issue with the use of selectors.
![]( id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62da895f5aa61882ef08bb05_React%20Selector.png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="A React code snippe)
id="">Well, it’s hard to do in NextJS….
id="">I am not saying it’s impossible but optimizing Redux properly for performance in NextJS can be very hard and takes a very long time.
## What are my options?
id="">Glad you asked; I am not saying that you should not use Redux in NextJS applications.
id="">All I am saying is ask yourself if you really need Redux. I will present you with some scenarios where you might think Redux is the way to go, but in reality, there are better alternatives.

### Scenario 1: You Already Know What’s on the Page
id="">Let’s just say you are building an e-commerce application where most of your URLs are pre-determined.

id="">So if you know that users will go to a page, <em id="">/product/{productId}</em> then you already know the <em id="">productId</em> even before you load the page. You can just pre-fetch the data, pre-generate the page, and send it to your visitors improving your application's performance.

id="">So <a href="https://medium.com/p/dadabf45e562" target="_blank" id="">if you know what data is going to be rendered</a> on the page before you load the actual page, then you can just use <em id="">getStaticProps</em> and <em id="">getServerSideProps</em> and get the job done like a boss.

id="">In this case, it’s tricky to use static generation because you have to fetch fresh data. Should you use Redux in this case?
