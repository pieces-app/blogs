# The Best Clipboard History Chrome Extensions
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p id="">In a user data survey conducted at the end of 2021, <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/12/30/how-often-do-people-actually-copy-and-paste-from-stack-overflow-now-we-know/" id="">StackOverflow</a> revealed that over the course of two weeks, users had copied text from their website over forty million times. While most computer users copy-paste at least occasionally, developers in particular are big users of this function, often copying code snippets to add to their codebase or to forward to others. If you’re a developer, this scenario might sound familiar: you copied a piece of text, then needed to copy another, and were annoyed to discover that you couldn’t keep both copied at the same time. Well, you’re not alone. This is why <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/clipboard%20history?_category=extensions" id="">clipboard history Chrome extensions</a> have grown rapidly on Google Chrome’s web store in recent years.<br><p.new.line><p id="">Clipboard history Chrome extensions generally allow you to store all of your copied text in your browser. Many provide additional features such as managing copied entries and syncing them across devices.<p.new.line><p id="">In this article, you’ll learn about the best clipboard history extensions for Chrome. These extensions were chosen for the features they offer, friendly user interfaces (UI), good user experiences (UX), and entry organization.<p.new.line><h2 id="">Try Pieces for Developers<h2.new.line><p id="">If you’re a developer who wants a better way to copy, share, and manage your frequently used code snippets, you might want to consider something more robust than a simple browser-based tool. Look at something like <a href="https://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" id="">Pieces for Developers</a> instead. Pieces for developers offers a desktop app and integrations for <a href="https://code.pieces.app/" target="_blank" id="">Visual Studio Code</a>, <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MeshIntelligentTechnologiesInc.pieces-vscode" target="_blank" id="">JetBrains</a>, and <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17328-pieces--save-search-share--reuse-code-snippets" target="_blank" id="">Chrome</a>. With Pieces, you can easily store code snippets with their related context and later reuse them across your environments. It also suggests snippets that you should save, allows you to share snippets with your team, and automatically enriches snippets, images, and other materials. Pieces is made by developers, for developers, and expands on the features offered by simple clipboard history Chrome extensions with unique functionality created to meet the needs of developers everywhere.<p.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center"><div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6419ce62045c6110e3600b5a_chrome.gif" loading="lazy" alt="The Pieces for Developers Chrome Extension in action."><div.new.line><figure.new.line><h2 id="">The Best Clipboard History Chrome Extensions<h2.new.line><h3 id="">Clipboard History Pro<h3.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type- w-richtext-align-center" data-rt-type="" data-rt-align="center"><div id=""><img alt="" src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62829a89e3ff0368e632daf0_1*Kdso6hDTf9SaZ7dSJ1NaxQ.png" width="auto" height="auto" loading="auto" id=""><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p id=""><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clipboard-history-pro-bes/ajiejmhbejpdgkkigpddefnjmgcbkenk/related?hl=en" target="_blank" id="">Clipboard History Pro</a> is one of the most popular Chrome clipboard history extensions, with more than 100,000 users and a 4.4-star rating (at the time of writing).
