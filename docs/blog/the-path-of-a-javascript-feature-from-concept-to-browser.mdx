id="">A standard is a piece of technical writing that defines rules, conditions, guidelines, or characteristics that anyone can refer to implement a solution.

id="">In 1994, with the increasing success of the organization, they renamed it simply Ecma. The reason for that change was to signal that they were changing the original mission of the association by becoming international and by operating on more diverse standardization topics like software, hardware, communications, media, storage, and more.
id="">TC39 is a technical committee composed of industry experts formed by Ecma to address multiple tasks regarding ECMAScript, the Javascript standard. Their work consists of:
- id="">Identifying, developing, and maintaining standards for libraries that extend the capabilities of ECMAScript<em id="">®</em>.
- id="">Building test suites to verify the correct implementation of these standards.
- id="">Contributing selected standards to ISO/IEC JTC 1.
- id="">Evaluating and considering proposals for complementary or additional technologies.
