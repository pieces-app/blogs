# JavaScript Tools Every Developer Should Know
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

## Best JavaScript Debugging Tools
id="">Debugging is a routine task in software development. Bugs can be caused by syntax errors, incorrect algorithms, incomplete loops, or other things entirely.
id="">According to <a href="https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3068754#:~:text=Software%20developers%20spend%2035%2D50,time%20validating%20and%20debugging%20software.&text=The%20cost%20of%20debugging%2C%20testing,more%20than%20%24100%20billion%20annually" target="_blank" id="">ACM Queue</a>, developers spend 35–50% of their time validating and debugging software, and debugging, testing, and verification can cost 50–75% of the total budget of a software project.
id="">Debugging tools for JavaScript simplify the process of finding these bugs, saving you time, energy, and resources. There are several types of tools that help with JavaScript debugging.

### Browser Console Tools

id="">The console object provides access to the browser’s debugging console via methods including console.log, console.trace, console.assert, and console.group. The following are some examples:
id="">console.log() is used for outputting text to the console. For example, to output a single object to the console, run this code:
id="">The output will be:
id="">You can also output multiple objects by listing them with the .info() method, as the following: 
id="">The output will be: 
id="">The .trace() method will show you the call path taken to reach the point at which you called console.trace(). For example, in this code: 
id="">The output of the code will look something like this:

id="">This is handy when you need to find all of the places in your code that call for a particular function. Just call console.trace() js at the point where the function is declared.
id="">Check our <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console" target="_blank" id="">MDN Web docs</a> for more about the browser console methods. 

### React Developer Tools &nbsp;

id="">React Developer Tools is a <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en" target="_blank" id="">Chrome </a>and <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/" target="_blank" id="">Firefox</a> DevTools extension for open source React JavaScript library. It allows you to debug your React application from your browser. Both the root component and the subcomponents show all loaded components, events, and states.

### Vue Devtools

### VS Code Built-In Debugger Tool
id="">If you use the popular Visual Studio Code editor, it comes with a <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/debugging" target="_blank" id="">powerful debugger</a> that helps accelerate your edit, compile, and debug loop. The VS Code documentation offers excellent information on how to use it.

## Linting/Code Formatting Tools
id="">Linting is the automated process of checking for programmatic or syntax errors during programming. A linter scans your code and flags style bugs or warnings about inconsistencies in code styles. For example, the code below has a syntax error that JavaScript wouldn’t approve:
id="">JavaScript does not allow the constant declaration of variables to be repeated. This sort of error is so minor that it would be hard to detect in a large codebase, but a linter would flag it. Some code formatters will also fix the code after detecting an error.
id="">The following are several good examples of JavaScript linters.

### Prettier
