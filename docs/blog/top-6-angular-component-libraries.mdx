![](ads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6390c3143c20ed6b9ff9be67_image2_ca821f0df91f0ebf5125703c247b1ef5_800.p)

Angular developers can use Google Maps services in their Angular apps by using Google Maps’ set of directives and services. Use of Google Maps in Angular was previously challenging due to the library's use of a script tag, which prevented easy access to the type definitions. This resulted in compilation errors. However, using Angular Google Maps directives, it’s simple to create maps, markers, shapes, lines, panes, and so on. Additionally, the library provides an asynchronous method that to check if the Google Maps library has been loaded on a certain web page.
- It can show a chosen latitude and longitude.
- It allows you to specify a route on Google Maps.
- It allows you to add and place markers.
- It shows the location on a map.

You can install Angular Google Maps simply by doing this:
e>//With npm<br>npm i @angular/google-maps</pre><p>N/B: In production, the Angular Google Maps module sometimes fails to render.
