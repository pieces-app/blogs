It’s a respectable way to bootstrap a generic SPA with client-side rendering. It is a straightforward CLI tool for starting Next.js applications.
### Get Started
We only need to execute the following command to produce the boilerplate:
e>$ npx create-next-app@latest next-app</pre><p>To start a dev server, we run:
### <strong>Pros and Cons of Create Next App</strong>
- It provides support for a quick refresh and fetch right out-of-the-box.
- It allows server-side rendering through the ```getServerSideProps()``` method.
- There is no optimization for programs that demand continuous data retrieval.

- It is strongly opinionated.
- It has an extremely large package library.
## 3) Vite
<a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vite</a> is a relatively new contender in the front end framework tools arena. With the addition of templates that support Vue, React and Preact, Vite is a universal solution to bootstrap applications from a variety of tech stacks and one of the strongest alternatives to Create React App.
### Get Started
To generate the boilerplate, we just need to run the following command:
e>$ npm create vite@latest</pre><p>After providing your “Project name,”  you’ll be prompted to select a framework:
![](ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6348223e69f4646bb1c071b0_image4_60db8e5150a83efc7322f30cb260b410_800.p)
When you choose the React option, a new React project will be created in the directory. We must enter the directory and install the ```vite``` package as a ```dev``` dependency after the repository has been configured:
e>$ cd react-vite<br>$ npm install</pre><p>Then, execute the following dev script:
e>$ npm run dev</pre><p>This brings up the default UI at  ```127.0.0.1:5173``` or ```localhost:3000``` depending on your Node.js/Vite version.

### Pros and Cons of Vite
- Its primary emphasis is on the developer experience (DX).
- It offers support for React and Typescript.
- Vite enables automatic build optimization.
- It offers support for preprocessors and CSS import with CSS modules.
- It offers support for Wasm and web workers.
- The building process is based on cutting-edge technologies, so it could be challenging to modify as needed.
- Importing SVG files as React Components is impossible without plugins.
- It is mandatory to “Import React” into every JSX file.
- It supports only JSX files for React.
## 4) React Starter Kit
Let's look at<a href="https://firebase.reactstarter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> React Starter Kit</a>, which bills itself as an isomorphic web project boilerplate and one of the strongest Create React App alternatives. Additionally, the React Starter Kit is described as, “very opinionated” on its webpage; this is because it has already chosen our tech stack for us, which consists of Node.js, Express and GraphQL.
### Get Started
We’ll clone the most recent repository in order to serve as the starting point for the boilerplate:
e>$ git clone https://github.com/kriasoft/react-firebase-starter.git example</pre><p><a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/npm-vs-yarn-how-do-they-compare" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Install the dependencies with yarn</a> by first moving them into the newly created folder:
e>$ cd example<br>$ yarn install</pre><p>Also, launch the development server as follows:
e>$ yarn start</pre><p>That gives us the simple boilerplate homepage we have here:
![](="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/6348223e69f464f286c071b5_image6_f76478a87fb885e5029ebd93507e5575_800.p)
### Pros and Cons of React Starter Kit
- It’s an isomorphic boilerplate that considers the server (Node.js) activities that need to be carried out, such as with SSR.
- React Starter Kit offers support for GraphQL through Apollo.
- It provides recipes for implementing typical use cases.
- It enables Enzyme's React testing and Flow's static type checking.
- It has a large number of dependencies.
- Its package size is extremely large.
- It is very opinionated.
