> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p id="">Your strengths as a software developer can be found not only in the code you write but also in the developer productivity tools you surround yourself with. From collaboration tools to management platforms, picking the right tools for the job is a skill that takes many years to develop — but it can be a determining factor in your productivity and efficiency as a developer.<p.new.line><p id="">Unfortunately, there are so many developer productivity tools out there that it can be hard to know where to start. Productivity tools can help you boost your performance, increase your happiness and satisfaction, and make the most of your work hours. The wrong tools, though, can slow you down and add unnecessary complexity to your daily routine.<p.new.line><p id="">In this article, you’ll learn about some of the most helpful productivity tools in several categories: time management, auto-completion, and collaboration. While not all of these tools will be a perfect fit for you, there’s sure to be a few that will take your productivity to new heights.<p.new.line><h2 id="">Pieces for Developers<h2.new.line><p id="">Every day, you encounter a snippet of code that should be stored for later use. Maybe you need to share it with your colleagues for review purposes, you’d like to take a closer look at its implementation, you want to use it to create documentation, or you want to use it in a future project.<p.new.line><p id="">Instead of pasting each snippet into a new document, consider <a href="https://code.pieces.app/install" target="_blank">Pieces for Developers</a>. Just download an extension for your favorite IDE, and you can save your most important snippets in just one click. Pieces for Developers allows you to save snippets from within the IDE or your Chrome browser without breaking your flow. It also captures important context about the snippet, making it easier to reference later.<p.new.line><p id="">Beyond saving snippets and other developer materials, Pieces for Developers allows you to share snippets via Pieces link or GitHub gist, search your saved materials in your IDE or in the Flagship Desktop App, and explore snippets of code with just a click. Your Pieces repository is also super searchable, not just for exact strings but by language and code structure. <p.new.line><p id="">This just scratches the surface of what Pieces for Developers can do; it’s truly the ultimate developer productivity tool.<p.new.line><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" data-rt-type="video" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="" data-rt-max-height="33.723653395784545%" data-rt-dimensions="854:480" data-page-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bczfW9wk8Bo&t=3s"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bczfW9wk8Bo?start=3" title="Meet Pieces for Developers | The future of code snippets"></iframe><div.new.line><figure.new.line><h2 id="">Time Management Developer Productivity Tools<br><h2.new.line><p id="">Time management is a struggle for many developers.

Your Pieces repository is also super searchable, not just for exact strings but by language and code structure.

### Habitica
id=""><a href="https://habitica.com" target="_blank">Habitica</a> gamifies your team’s goals, making productivity an enjoyable group challenge. Just like in an RPG, you start by creating a character, but unlike an RPG, the monsters you fight and quests that you’re sent on are correlated with the tasks and daily goals that you set. Every day, you log your progress, unlocking awards and in-game add-ons if you complete your tasks — or losing them if you fail to stick to your plans.
