# Pieces User Stories: Share code with context

<p id="">Like most machine learning engineers, Greg understands the importance of organization. Just take a peek at his Pieces repo— everything is titled, tagged and described so that he can find a snippet <em id="">and</em> know exactly how to use it in no time.<p.new.line><p id="">“I like to keep my snippets organized with a bit of information about what they are and why they're here,” says Greg. With Pieces, it’s faster than ever for him to add all of that information, because nearly all of it is automatically generated. “This snippet has a quick description, a related link, some tags— these were actually auto-generated, and the link was auto-saved to that one. The description was automatically generated on this one, too.”<p.new.line><p id="">Automatically adding context to snippets isn’t the only way that Pieces helps Greg save time. From keyboard shortcuts to easy search, Pieces reduces the time it takes to find a snippet and remember how to use it.<p.new.line><p id="">“So there's a data science library called Pandas, which is used for working with data frames. And in Pandas, there are a lot of similar functions for manipulating these frames. Merge, join, concatenate, and compare are four similar functions that you would use; merge, join, and concatenate are all different ways of taking multiple frames and combining them into one,” explains Greg. Then he pulls up the snippet’s information view. “So I have notes about when and where to use them in here, and here's a related link that goes to the Pandas documentation page. Now I don't have to memorize which one to use when— I just have a clear example in Pieces.”<p.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-center" style="max-width:2134px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="center" data-rt-max-width="2134px"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62f178c2f4eb6738210b328a_image%20(1).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="Pandas inside of Pieces code view"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><figure id="" class="w-richtext-figure-type-image w-richtext-align-fullwidth" style="max-width:2134px" data-rt-type="image" data-rt-align="fullwidth" data-rt-max-width="2134px"><div id=""><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/62f178cf5cac0a293990b48e_image%20(2).png" loading="lazy" id="" width="auto" height="auto" alt="pandas inside of pieces information view"><div.new.line><figure.new.line><p i
