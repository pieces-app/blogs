## Python vs Golang: Fundamentals
### What is Python?
<u><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python</a></u> is a very sought-after, high-level programming language with a general purpose. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected, and supports multiple <u><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-introduction-to-programming-paradigms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programming paradigms</a></u> including <u><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/structured-programming-modular-programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">structured</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">object-oriented</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/3613715/what-is-functional-programming-a-practical-guide.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">functional programming</a></u>.
Python is also an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Combining the high-level build in data structures with dynamic typing and binding makes it very appealing for swift application development and as a scripting or cementing language to connect existing components. Python has an easy-to-learn syntax that highlights readability and narrows the cost of maintaining a program. Python supports modules and packages, which motivates program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are accessible in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms making it free to distribute.
### What is Python used for?
Python is used to create various programs and isn&#x27;t specialized for specific problems. For example, we can use Python for data analytics, AI and machine learning, web scraping and data visualization.
You can program all kinds of applications with Python. You can use this general-purpose language to read and create file directories, GUIs, APIs, and more. You can build them all with Python, whether blockchain applications, audio and video apps or machine learning applications.
It&#x27;s feasible to create simple games using the programming language, which can be helpful in quickly developing a prototype.
Python&#x27;s simple and elegant design and syntax have inspired the creation of new programming languages like Cobra, CoffeeScript, and Go, all using a similar syntax to Python.
This highlights that Python is a valuable blueprint language. So, if you&#x27;re a newbie in programming, understanding Python can help you easily branch out into other areas.
It is a valuable tool in deciding asset price trends and predictions and automating workflows across different data sources.
This area often benefits from automation, which is possible through Python. Whether implementing changes across multiple pages or categorizing keywords, Python will assist you.
You can use Python to develop graphic design applications. Surprisingly, the language is used across 2D imaging software, like Gimp.
Python is also used in 3D animation software such as Lightwave, Blender and Cinema 4D.
### What is Golang?
<u><a href="https://go.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Golang</a></u> is a procedural, statically typed and compiled programming language created by Google developers <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Griesemer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert Griesemer</a></u>, <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Pike" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Pike</a></u>, and <u><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ken Thompson</a></u>. They started Golang because complexity was increasing in the codebases within Google, and they didn’t fancy C++. Golang was publicly announced in 2009, and it was made an open-source language in 2012 with the release of its first version.
Golang quickly became popular and many developers’ first choice because of its simplicity, efficiency and ability to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
Golang is used for server-side (backend) programming, game development, <u><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchcloudcomputing/tip/11-cloud-programming-languages-developers-need-to-know" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cloud-based programming</a></u> and even data science. It’s pretty famous for making command-line tools.
Today, many people in tech use Golang, including developers at Google, Netflix, Twitch, Ethereum, Dropbox and so on.
Unsurprisingly, <u><a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes</a></u>, <u><a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker</a></u> and <u><a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heroku</a></u> are using Golang because cloud-based programming is one of the main reasons Golang was designed.
### What is Golang used for?
The reason why Google created Golang is to clear up software issues of scalability, where resources are limited by hardware. In other words, it’s convenient when it addresses bottleneck issues in processing time.
Usually, late-stage startups and other large companies with many users will have issues wherein the backend finds it challenging to cope with the volume of activities. Golang’s support for coexisting functions and small memory footprint is a perfect fit for backend development where servers must deal with substantial requests.
Dropbox, a cloud-storage sharing service, uses Golang to efficiently manage more than 500 million users on its network. Golang is also ideal for building e-commerce sites that handle millions of monthly visits.
## Pros and Cons of Python and Golang

![](loads-ssl.webflow.com/6143afec68f555387049efb3/637e3c9894c8648bc65c5acb_Screenshot2022-11-14at10_12_05AM_ddb6fc7000009c36b2d9ce843f345e6e_800.p)
## Which is better: Python or Golang?
Programmers like Python because they can formulate machine learning models with it and there is no compilation process. The edit-test-debug cycle is quick. Debugging Python programs is straightforward: bugs or wrong input will not cause a segmentation fault. Instead, whenever the interpreter finds an error, it raises an exception. The interpreter prints a stack sketch when the program doesn&#x27;t catch the exception. A <u><a href="https://melodict.com/source-level_debugger" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">source-level debugger</a></u> allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, etc. The debugger is written in Python, testifying to Python&#x27;s introspective power.
Golang is better for developers that want to be more productive. The syntax is limited, and it has fewer heavy libraries. Getting work done in fewer lines of code is quicker as less code is available to write. Python has an edge in versatility solely because of the many libraries and the range of syntax. However, versatility also comes at the price of productivity.
## Conclusion
There is a substitute for every programming language, and Golang is no different. However, despite the simplicity and speed of executing the code built with Golang, it takes more effort to develop than a scripting language like Python. It’s undeniable that Go is a promising language, but it has yet to feasibly build every type of application.
