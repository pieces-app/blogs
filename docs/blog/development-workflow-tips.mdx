# 10 Development Workflow Tips to Boost Productivity
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)
<p id="">A productive development workflow is an essential skill for your success as a developer.<p.new.line><p id="">I‚Äôm not talking about working late nights or never taking breaks; It‚Äôs more about learning to set your priorities and goals and protecting your precious time.<p.new.line><p id="">All of this is especially important if you‚Äôre new to the software development industry. You have a window of opportunity to lay a strong foundation for making every day successful.<p.new.line><p id="">If you learn to use the right tools and set the proper habits, increased productivity will lead to more happiness and work-life balance, more fun at work, increased respect from peers, and many opportunities for advancement in your field.<p.new.line><p id="">To help you set the right foundation, here are 10 of the best tips to improve developer productivity.<p.new.line><h2 id="">1. Automate Everything You Can<h2.new.line><p id="">Why spend one hour a day performing the same repetitive task in your development workflow when you could spend that time automating your chores forever?<p.new.line><p id="">In my job, for example, I realized that I spent a lot of time looking for tickets assigned to me on GitHub, so I wrote a little script that automatically sorts them and shows them to me in my note-taking tool.<p.new.line><p id="">Little actions like these can save you hours in the long run. Automating repetitive duties, from pushing to GitHub or migrating the DB, allow you to focus on the bigger challenges you need to tackle.<p.new.line><p id="">Today, try to look at your daily workflow and ask yourself: which repetitive tasks could be automated and how? Taking action is a surefire way to improve developer productivity.<p.new.line><h2 id="">2. Use the Command Line<h2.new.line><p id="">The command line is the secret weapon of every expert developer. You‚Äôre probably already using it every day to start the local servers of your app, but if you can take the time to explore and master this tool, it will do wonders for your development workflow.<p.new.line><p id="">Navigating through UI, working with Git‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääall of these operations take a lot less time when you grasp a few good command-line instructions.<p.new.line><p id=""><strong id="">üí° Pro tip</strong>: If you want to streamline your developer workflow with a CLI even further, take a look at the complex commands that you frequently run and <a href="https://jonsuh.com/blog/bash-command-line-shortcuts/" target="_blank">write aliases</a> for them.<p.new.line><h2 id="">3. Take Regular Breaks<h2.new.line><p id="">As a human being, you have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span" target="_blank">maximum attention span.</a> Don‚Äôt expect to be highly focused for eight hours straight. Instead, shorter bursts of work are much better for your development workflow.<p.new.line><p id="">Try to work on a time frame of forty-five minutes to one hour with breaks in between. You‚Äôll notice many benefits, including:<p.new.line><ul id=""><li id="">Increased focus: By reducing the number of connected hours you have to focus, your brain will be less overwhelmed and more able to concentrate.<li.new.line><li id="">Easier to resist temptations: If you know you‚Äôll have breaks during the day, you‚Äôll be more inclined to focus on your current task and not let your mind wander. <li.new.line><ul.new.line><h2 id="">4. Remove All Distractions<h2.new.line><p id="">According to a study conducted by the University of California Irvine, if you get distracted, it will take you an average of twenty-three minutes to regain control of the task you were busy with. Imagine how much time you could have saved by eliminating all of the distractions around you!<p.new.line><p id="">Coding is an attention-heavy job; you must be highly focused on your development workflow if you want to accomplish something.<p.new.line><p id="">When it‚Äôs time to work, make bad habits harder to pursue. Turn off your phone completely, or leave it where it‚Äôs hard to reach. If you‚Äôre working from home, ask your family not to distract you.<p.new.line><p id="">Don‚Äôt listen to music if it can be a source of distraction, or use relaxing sounds like lo-fi to help you focus.<p.new.line><blockquote id="">‚ÄúBad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don‚Äôt want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.‚Äù- James Clear</blockquote><h2 id="">5. Don‚Äôt Multitask<h2.new.line><p id="">During your work day, you might be tempted to switch between multiple tasks. While you‚Äôre reviewing code, you may switch back to debugging your latest feature.<p.new.line><p id="">When you do this, you‚Äôre actually forcing your brain to reset every time you switch between contexts. Whenever you task switch, it takes a long time to get a hang of what‚Äôs happening.<p.new.line><p id="">Plus, context-switching is highly time-consuming in a software development workflow. If you want to work on two different features, you have to switch branches, restart the server, and download each branch‚Äôs dependencies.<p.new.line><p id="">Don‚Äôt try to rush. Focusing on one task at a time is always better than trying to achieve ten different things at the same time.<p.new.line><h2 id="">6. Communicate with Your Peers<h2.new.line><p id="">Being stuck on a problem is frustrating, and you might be tempted to not share your issue with your colleagues out of fear of being judged as a bad developer.<p.new.line><p id="">Remember, your colleagues have the same goal as you‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto deliver a working solution that clients will want to use. Never hesitate to ask for their help or opinion.<p.new.line><p id="">I usually follow this rule of thumb: if I‚Äôve been stuck on the same problem for more than two hours, and if I‚Äôve tested all possible solutions I could think of, I will contact one of my colleagues. It‚Äôs a really excellent developer productivity hack!<p.new.line><h2 id="">7. Plan What You‚Äôre Going to Do for the Day<h2.new.line><p id="">Your time is always going to be limited, which is why you should focus on prioritizing certain tasks over others.<p.new.line><p id="">Every morning, or even the night before, write down exactly what you must accomplish during your work day. Don‚Äôt aim to compile a list with thirty items. Focus on just 3-5 items, or you will risk burning out or and feeling accomplished.<p.new.line><p id="">Also, be specific about what you want to do. Don‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúTomorrow I will do some code reviews.‚Äù Instead, say, ‚ÄúTomorrow, from 4 pm to 6 pm, I will review two pull requests.‚Äù<p.new.line><h2 id="">8. Never Strive for Perfection<h2.new.line><p id="">At the beginning of your career, you might be tempted to try and write the most perfect solution for the problems you‚Äôre facing. You will obsess over a few lines of code, trying to make them perfect.<p.new.line><p id="">This behavior will take you in exactly the opposite direction that you expect. It will slow you down tremendously, even for the easiest tasks.<p.new.line><blockquote id="">‚ÄúFind a judo solution, one that delivers maximum efficiency with minimum effort. When good enough gets the job done, go for it.‚Äù- Jason Fried</blockquote><p id="">Don‚Äôt strive for perfection when writing software. Remember: there‚Äôs never a perfect solution, but there is a good solution for your particular case. You will always have to find a compromise between readability, maintenance, and performance.<p.new.line><p id="">Strive to deliver code that works, is readable, and can be scaled in the future. And remember, as the author of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup, always like to remind us in his <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html" target="_blank">book for beginning developers</a>:<p.new.line><blockquote id="">‚ÄúPerfect is the enemy of good.‚Äù ‚ÄìVoltaire</blockquote><h2 id="">9. Start with Complex Tasks First<h2.new.line><p id="">As <a href="https://www.briantracy.com/blog/time-management/the-truth-about-frogs/" target="_blank">Brian Tracy</a>, the famous author of the book <em id="">Eat That Frog</em>, says, you should always start your work day with the most important tasks for yourself.<p.new.line><p id="">How do you find the most important task for you? Identify the thing you can do that makes the biggest impact on your work.<p.new.line><p id="">Is it creating new features? Bug fixing? Reviewing code?<p.new.line><p id="">Identify what it is, and then start your day with that task.<p.new.line><p id="">You might have noticed that your energy levels decrease during the day. If you focus on the most important task first, you can handle less demanding tasks at the end of the day when you‚Äôre exhausted.<p.new.line><p id="">This development workflow habit not only increases your morale during the day, it also helps your career progress faster.<p.new.line><h2 id="">10. Leverage Development Workflow Tools<h2.new.line><p id="">This developer productivity tip might be the most impactful on the list, as it combines several other developer productivity hacks.
