# Pieces User Stories: Auto-complete boilerplate code
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

## From developing APIs to streamlining internal ops to building micro-utilities, Full Stack Engineer Brandon’s work is different every day. The ways he uses Pieces are similarly varied.
One feature that he started using recently is auto-complete. “Auto-complete was pretty useful on some of the boilerplate code that I use in my C++ and CMake projects, where I copy certain things a lot and there's not really a good way to abstract it out. So, Pieces auto-completed it and nearly took care of everything for me.”

The snippet Brandon uses across all of his C++ projects to bring in Catch2, a popular open-source testing framework.

A lot of developers prefer writing code over the more “menial” chores like documenting their code and writing unit tests. Unit tests are extraordinarily powerful when combined with test automation + CI/CD systems, and go a long way to improve software stability. But the caveat is that you have to actually write your tests! “I save these two snippets in Pieces so I can use auto-complete to write tests faster and sleep better at night knowing I’ve tested the code I put into production.”
