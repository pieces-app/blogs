# GitHub + Pieces: Top 10 Ways Pieces Optimizes Your Development Workflow with AI
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Last week, Tsavo Knott, CEO of Pieces for Developers, a first-in-kind productivity suite that optimizes developer workflow and eliminates the chaos of context switching, showcased Pieces on GitHub‚Äôs YouTube channel and across their social media. This was the inaugural episode of GitHub‚Äôs ‚ÄòStart it up Wednesday,‚Äô a new show hosted by GitHub‚Äôs Rizel Scarlett. Knott showcased a modern developer‚Äôs workflow on the episode titled, ‚ÄúOptimizing your Development Workflow with AI.‚Äù

> "ChatGPT and GitHub Co-Pilot are dramatically increasing the volume of code being written every day. With that we are seeing a role-change in developer workflows, where there is not only an increased need to curate from these generated materials; but further, developers are needing to save, search, share, reference, and reuse the outputs of Generative AI like we've never seen before." - Tsavo Knott

The Live Stream was over an hour long and showcased mind-bending edge ML that left the audience awestruck. Knott demoed the latest features of the Pieces Desktop app, including the ability to generate new code from a short plain English description, provide relevant descriptions and links to external resources, and share with teammates (soon via Microsoft Teams). He also demonstrated offline capabilities, proving that the age of on-device ML is here.

We've created a Top 10 Highlight reel of the event, showcasing how Pieces for Developers can optimize your development workflow using AI. It's the first-ever 'Top 10' highlight list curated for ChatGPT integrations and on-device ML. Get ready to witness some incredible new heights in the world of developer tools and machine learning.

Let's go!

## Curate Code Snippets with Pieces...Titles, Tags, Related Doc Links, Suggested Searches & More

Knott provided an overview of Pieces for Developers, its origin, and its focus. Pieces is an AI-powered suite that helps developers curate the growing volume of AI-generated materials with auto-enrichment. It makes it easy to save, search, share, reference, and reuse code that is generated and found throughout the common development workflow.

### Saving Code in Pieces
Developers typically save useful snippets using a notes app or Google doc. However, Knott demonstrated how Pieces can intelligently curate and enrich important developer materials throughout a developer's workflow. With copy and paste commands, developers can save snippets, retain syntax highlighting, and leverage AI-generated tags, descriptions, and links for easier in-app search using natural language.

### Save code from ChatGPT with the Pieces Chrome Extension
Generative AI is creating an increasing amount of code, and Pieces provides the best platform for capturing these code snippets along with their related links, descriptions, and more. It's an excellent way for developers to leverage the power of ChatGPT.

### Discovering Related Snippets in Pieces with GPT4
Knott demonstrated how developers can use Generative AI in the desktop app to discover related code snippets that are automatically curated and enriched. This allows developers to directly leverage the power of GPT4 within Pieces, eliminating the need to switch between tools and copy/paste. Additionally, code snippets saved in Pieces become searchable and easily accessible throughout a developer's workflow and within their IDE.

### Exploring Global Search - "An Offline Google for resources Saved in Pieces"
As you save more materials throughout your workflow, the importance of search becomes more significant. With Global Search, you can quickly locate your developer materials. Not only does this make it easier to find, but Global Search also ranks materials based on their relevance to your current work.

## Air-Gapped, Local and On-Device. Using Pieces in a Secure Environment
You don't need an internet connection to benefit from machine learning anymore. Pieces' in-house ML works completely offline and on-device, providing a customized experience that accompanies you wherever you go, whether you're connected to Wi-Fi or not. This makes it extremely secure and safe to use in highly controlled environments.

## Extracting Code from Screenshots with OCR & LLMs
‚ÄúI‚Äôve always wished I could do this...‚Äù Well, now you can, Rizel! Developers and anyone who wants to turn screenshots into code or text can easily do so by dragging and dropping the screenshot directly into the Pieces Desktop app. The app then converts the screenshot into code or text, complete with auto-generated metadata.

### Generate and Transform code from JavaScript to Ruby
Generative-AI creates a snippet and then transforms the code into a new language, directly in Pieces. ü§Øü§Øü§Ø This is cutting-edge ML that minimizes context switching and maximized developer productivity! Check out this example of Knott asking Pieces for Developers to generate a JavaScript snippet and then convert it into Ruby.
