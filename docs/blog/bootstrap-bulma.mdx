Bootstrap is a free, open-source, front-end development framework used to build websites and web applications. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> offers a collection of vocabulary for template designs and is designed to enable responsive, mobile-first websites. <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> is a cutting-edge CSS framework that is open source, free, and useful for creating responsive web sites. <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/understanding-bulma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s one of the top CSS frameworks</a> for front-end development, and is based on Flexbox. Bulma was created by Jeremy Thomas, and an MIT license is used to license the Bulma source code. In this article, we’ll compare Bulma vs Bootstrap.
## Bulma vs Bootstrap: Features
### Bootstrap
- Design templates for buttons, navigation, and other elements that are based on HTML and CSS
- Reusable code with CSS classes
- Modularity for modifying or eliminating certain components or component colors
- Components made using JavaScript out of the box that have extra functionality like tooltips, modal windows, etc.
### Bulma CSS
- Every component of Bulma is designed with mobile devices in mind and is optimized for vertical reading
- Vertically stacked columns
- The nav menu is hidden
- The level component displays its children stacked vertically. However, by adding the is-mobile property, you can make sure that both columns or levels are laid down horizontally.
- Modularity: You can import each of the 39 .sass files that make up Bulma separately
- Flexbox-powered columns
## Pros and Cons of Bootstrap vs Bulma
### Bootstrap
Let’s have a look at some advantages of Bootstrap:
- Simple to use: Anyone can start using Bootstrap with just a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- Responsive Features: The responsive CSS in Bootstrap adapts to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.

- Easy to modify: You can do anything with the code because it’s completely open-source, and knowledgeable users can significantly alter the framework.
- Utilizes a grid: Developers can much more easily control where pieces appear on their sites thanks to the grid concept.
- Widely compatible: Nearly all current browsers are compatible with Bootstrap (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, and Opera).
Anything with benefits must also have some drawbacks. Let's examine some of Bootstrap's cons:

- You might depend on it excessively. If you become dependent on it, you'll never learn how to create a website from scratch (although you may never need to).
- It might not be as efficient as you would like. Bootstrap has a reputation for being big since it contains everything you could possibly need. It’s not ideal for building modest, straightforward websites.
- Its naming convention can be perplexing. You must invest the time up front to become familiar with Bootstrap's features. Because there is no way to intuit what is present or what it is named, it may necessitate extensive documentation.
