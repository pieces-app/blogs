> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Bootstrap is a free, open-source, front-end development framework used to build websites and web applications. <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bootstrap</a> offers a collection of vocabulary for template designs and is designed to enable responsive, mobile-first websites. <a href="https://bulma.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bulma</a> is a cutting-edge CSS framework that is open source, free, and useful for creating responsive web sites. <a href="https://code.pieces.app/blog/understanding-bulma" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s one of the top CSS frameworks</a> for front-end development, and is based on Flexbox. Bulma was created by Jeremy Thomas, and an MIT license is used to license the Bulma source code. In this article, we’ll compare Bulma vs Bootstrap.

## Bulma vs Bootstrap: Features

### Bootstrap
- Design templates for buttons, navigation, and other elements that are based on HTML and CSS
- Reusable code with CSS classes
- Modularity for modifying or eliminating certain components or component colors
- Components made using JavaScript out of the box that have extra functionality like tooltips, modal windows, etc.

### Bulma CSS
- Every component of Bulma is designed with mobile devices in mind and is optimized for vertical reading
- Vertically stacked columns
- The nav menu is hidden
- The level component displays its children stacked vertically. However, by adding the is-mobile property, you can make sure that both columns or levels are laid down horizontally.
- Modularity: You can import each of the 39 .sass files that make up Bulma separately
- Flexbox-powered columns

## Pros and Cons of Bootstrap vs Bulma

### Bootstrap
Let’s have a look at some advantages of Bootstrap:
- Simple to use: Anyone can start using Bootstrap with just a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.
- Responsive Features: The responsive CSS in Bootstrap adapts to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
- Mobile-first strategy: Mobile-first styles are a core component of Bootstrap 3's framework.
- Easy to modify: You can do anything with the code because it’s completely open-source, and knowledgeable users can significantly alter the framework.
- Utilizes a grid: Developers can much more easily control where pieces appear on their sites thanks to the grid concept.
- Widely compatible: Nearly all current browsers are compatible with Bootstrap (Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Edge, Safari, and Opera).

Anything with benefits must also have some drawbacks. Let's examine some of Bootstrap's cons:
- You must be familiar with coding to use it. You probably won't be able to use Bootstrap if you’re a true beginner. A CMS like WordPress is a better option for non-programmers.
- You might depend on it excessively. If you become dependent on it, you'll never learn how to create a website from scratch (although you may never need to).
- It might not be as efficient as you would like. Bootstrap has a reputation for being big since it contains everything you could possibly need. It’s not ideal for building modest, straightforward websites.
- Its naming convention can be perplexing. You must invest the time up front to become familiar with Bootstrap's features. Because there is no way to intuit what is present or what it is named, it may necessitate extensive documentation.

### Bulma CSS
Let’s list some of the advantages of Bulma CSS:
- Free and open source
- Lightweight
- Customizable
- Platform-independent
- Simple to use and learn
- Compatible with the majority of current browsers
- Mobile-first framework
- Dependable documentation
- Supports Font Awesome versions 4 and 5
- Provides a number of ready-to-use parts
- Installing JavaScript is not necessary because it offers a lot of helpful tools

Cons of Bulma:
- Bulma is a CSS-only framework, unlike Bootstrap. It does not come with JavaScript or jQuery preinstalled. Writing a custom script is necessary in order to add some fundamental features to Bulma, such as a toggle, which needs JavaScript or jQuery.
- Its documentation is generally less strong than Bootstrap’s.
- It has comparatively little community support to Bootstrap.

## Similarities Between Bootstrap and Bulma CSS
Bulma CSS and Bootstrap share some characteristics. Here’s what the two have in common:
