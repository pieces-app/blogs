# Create an Easy Slider for an E-commerce Dashboard With Swiper.js
> Wed Apr 05 2023 16:53:15 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

Easy access to a product often leads to an increase in demand for it. In an e-commerce website, visibility means a lot. Products that are easily seen usually have higher sales rates. Several React components make it simple for goods and products to be easily seen on an e-commerce site. These components include FullPage.js, Swiper.js, ReactSwipable, and more.
In this article, we’ll learn what Swiper.js is, highlight its functionalities, and explore a potential use case in an e-commerce website. This information is important because it makes developers aware of useful tools like Swiper.js that easily implement amazing UI features.

<strong>Prerequisites:</strong>
To follow this tutorial, you’ll need the following:
- A clear understanding of frontend technologies, i.e. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    • Node.js installed on your computer.
    • Basic knowledge of React.js.

## What is Swiper.js?
The best on the market, Swiper is a cutting-edge free mobile carousel component with impressive native behavior and hardware-accelerated transitions. It’s intended to be used in mobile websites, mobile web apps, and mobile native/hybrid apps. Swiper is a modern touch slider focused only on modern apps/platforms to provide the best experience, as well as simplicity. It’s available for most popular frameworks like React, Vue, Angular, and so on. In addition, Swiper is a part of Framework 7, a comprehensive framework for building iOS and Android apps, and it’s also a default slider component in the Ionic Framework. To use Swiper.js, you must install it with its npm package:
Swiper.js is mostly used for sliders or carousels. The following are some of the use cases of Swiper.js:
- <strong>Image gallery organization:</strong> With Swiper.js, images and contents are easily managed. Developers only need to install Swiper.js to use any of its properties.
- <strong>Multiple-display navigation:</strong> Swiper.js' exceptional multiple-display navigation implementation allows users to view more content without clicking or scrolling.
- <strong>Dashboard animation:</strong> A dashboard should be interactive and have a good display. With Swiper.js, dashboard animation is very easy, from display to interaction.

### Styling the Dashboard
By default, Swiper React uses the core version of Swiper without any additional modules. Therefore, to use any other Swiper.js modules, they need to be installed. <br>Swiper.js must be installed in the application before we start working on the dashboard UI.  To do this, let’s run the accompanying command in the working directory of the application:
e>npm install swiper</pre><p><a href="https://maryanda.pieces.cloud/?p=858c4e881d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save this code</a>

After Swiper.js has been successfully installed in the application environment, we need to import the required methods and files into the &quot;App.js&quot; component. In this instance, we’re importing the following:
e>import React from &quot;react&quot;;<br>// Import Swiper React components;<br>import { Swiper, SwiperSlide } from &quot;swiper/react&quot;;<br>import { Navigation, Autoplay } from &quot;swiper&quot;;<br>// Import Swiper styles;<br>import &quot;swiper/css&quot;;<br>import &quot;swiper/css/pagination&quot;;<br>import &quot;./styles.css&quot;;<br>// import required modules;<br>import { Pagination } from &quot;swiper&quot;;</pre><p><a href="https://maryanda.pieces.cloud/?p=c0104eb42f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save this code</a>
In the above code snippet, we imported React, Swiper, and SwiperSlide from ```swiper/react```, Navigation and Autoplay from “Swiper,” ```swiper/css, swiper/css/pagination```, ```styles.css``` (our custom CSS stylesheet), and Pagination from ```swiper```.<br>Our stylesheet is located in the 'styles.css' file that we imported. The styles in this article are contained in the stylesheet. (<a href="https://gist.github.com/prince-joel/ede986dba221767999f27352b886bb51" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gist</a>)

Now, we’ll create a new variable called ```pagination``` inside the ```App.js``` component, which will be used as the Swiper component's pagination option.<br>The ```pagination``` component shows an active slide and a button that can be clicked to move between slides. The ```pagination``` is made using the following code:
e>const pagination = {<br>   clickable: true,<br>    renderBullet: function (index: number, className: string) {<br> return '&lt;span class=&quot;' + className + '&quot;&gt;' + (index + 1) + &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;;<br>   },<br> };</pre><p><a href="https://maryanda.pieces.cloud/?p=2ecb488f82" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save this code</a>
Next, we need to create the returned content of the ```App.js``` component. A hero section with a full-width slider, a 3-column grid slider, and a 3-column grid product gallery make up this content.<br>The complete code is available here: <a href="https://gist.github.com/prince-joel/91458840e0586f7661e559919373b89a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gist</a>.<br>In the gist, you can see that the ```Swiper``` component was used various times, as shown in this example:
e>&lt;Swiper<br>         pagination={pagination}<br>         autoplay={{<br>           delay: 4000,<br>           disableOnInteraction: true,<br>         }} modules={[Navigation, Autoplay, Pagination]}<br>&gt;<br>&lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>&lt;img src={img1} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Slide 1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SwiperSlide&gt; &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;&lt;img src={img2} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Slide 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SwiperSlide&gt; &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;&lt;img src={img3} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Slide 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SwiperSlide&gt; &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;&lt;img src={img4} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Slide 4&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>&lt;/Swiper&gt;</pre><p><a href="https://maryanda.pieces.cloud/?p=def04f9998" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save this code</a>

The code snippet above shows the component for the hero section full-width slider. The ```Swiper``` component wraps a group of ```SwiperSlide``` components and accepts options, including the following:
- Pagination: an object that returns a component for pagination.
- Autoplay: an object used to set the amount of time it takes for the slide to change to the next slide automatically. We can also set the slide to stop changing if a user interacts with it.
- Modules: an array of methods used in a particular Swiper slide.
The ```SwiperSlide``` components then wrap the main content that each slide show displays. In this case, we only wanted to display images, so we passed the ```img``` tag as a child to this component. This can be seen in the image below:

Another example is the effect-card slider. This slider arranges the ```SwiperSlider``` as a stack of cards, and users can use the mouse to shuffle between the stack. We can implement the effect-card slider with this format:
e>&lt;Swiper effect={&quot;cards&quot;} grabCursor={true} modules={[EffectCards]} className=&quot;mySwiper center-main&quot; &gt;<br>        &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>         &lt;img src={img5} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>             &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>             &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>         &lt;img src={img6} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>             &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>             &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>         &lt;img src={img7} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>       &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>       &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>         &lt;img src={img8} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>       &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>&lt;/Swiper&gt;</pre><p><a href="https://maryanda.pieces.cloud/?p=422c4fbe13" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save this code<br></a>In the code snippet above, we used the ```cards``` options for the ```effect``` props, and we also set the ```grabCursor``` props to true, which enables users to drag each slide into view. We must also set the ```modules``` props to ```EffectCards```.<br>The image below illustrates the outcome:

Another example is the 3-column slider. We have a div containing 3 similar sliders with this format:
e>&lt;Swiper navigation={true}<br>           autoplay={{<br>             delay: 2500,<br>             disableOnInteraction: false,<br>           }} modules={[Navigation, Autoplay]} className=&quot;mySwiper&quot;&gt;<br>           &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>            &lt;img src={img9} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>           &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>           &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>            &lt;img src={img5} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>           &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>           &lt;SwiperSlide&gt;<br>            &lt;img src={img6} loading=&quot;lazy&quot; alt=&quot;Product 1&quot; /&gt;<br>           &lt;/SwiperSlide&gt;<br>&lt;/Swiper&gt;</pre><p><a href="https://maryanda.pieces.cloud/?p=bc6346bbee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Save this code</a>
In this case, we are passing more content than just images into the ```SwiperSlide``` component. Here is what the result looks like:
