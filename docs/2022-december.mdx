<Accordion title="Comparing SSR and SSG in Next.js Applications">
    Server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) are different techniques used for data fetching or pre-rendering. Pre-rendering is a technique used to rapidly preload elements in an application.

    Pre-rendering in an application shows a snapshot of the requested site first as the page data is being loaded in the background. This helps reduce bounce rate and is advantageous for enabling web crawlers to quickly parse through the content of a site and index it.

<Accordion title="Getting Started With SolidJS">
    SolidJS is a JavaScript declarative User Interface (UI) library for web applications. It is comparable to other JavaScript frameworks like Svelte, React, and Vue. Ryan Carniato developed SolidJS, which was released as open-source in 2018.

    Almost all of SolidJS's principles align with those of other frameworks, with a few exceptions. For instance, the components are rendered only once, and there is no virtual DOM. These characteristics help explain why apps created with SolidJS run at lightning speeds, making it one of the fastest JavaScript frameworks on the market right now.
