<Accordion title="How to write, test and deploy Ethereum smart contracts using Truffle">
    Ethereum is a public blockchain that serves as the foundation for creating decentralized, permissionless, censorship-resistant apps and organizations. To develop these apps (DApps), Ethereum allows developers to write and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum network.

    This article will look at writing, testing and deploying a smart contract using the Solidity programming language and Truffle. We will explore functions and state variables. To find a pattern in how to develop our smart contract, we test it along the way to know if we are on the right track. To help us here, we will adopt a test-driven development (TDD) approach for quick feedback. Additionally, we will develop our skills with the Truffle framework, which offers tools for deploying and testing our contracts.
