    As a QA Engineer, Ben is familiar with how software is supposed to work— as he dives into development, Pieces has become super useful to his learning process.

    Pieces has been most helpful to Ben when searching for help online. “What's so cool about coding is you can think a thought and type it straight into StackOverflow or Google, and you can find someone who's done something that’s relatively close to what you’re trying to do. For me, Pieces bridges those gaps in knowledge between what I know and what someone else knows.

    In the three years since Liam began teaching himself to code, he’s experimented with nearly every developer tool on the internet— including Pieces. While it seemed like a nice-to-have when he first downloaded it, over time, Pieces transformed his workflow. “Now months into my Pieces journey, the app has become more and more useful for me every day.”

<Accordion title="Pieces User Stories: Easily find solutions to errors">
    Though Karam started using Pieces only a few months ago, the ways he uses it continuously evolve. “When I was new to Pieces, I was also new to coding. The work I was doing was always foreign; It felt like every time I wrote code, it was the first time I wrote it. I didn’t have anything to reuse ever because everything was a new frontier. As a young developer, but also as a fast case developer, I'm not doing the same thing over and over again. So, I've used Pieces in different workflows.”

    As a polyglot and a machine learning engineer, Rocco is no stranger to taking on something new. When he started to code in Dart, Pieces helped him to learn more quickly.

    “Logically, I know how to code something, but I don’t know exactly what the syntax is, where the curly brackets go, or whatever. Well, if you have snippets in Pieces, you look at them more often and just by looking at those snippets, you learn the syntax from the way they look.”

<Accordion title="Pieces User Stories: Auto-complete boilerplate code">
    From developing APIs to streamlining internal ops to building micro-utilities, Full Stack Engineer Brandon’s work is different every day. The ways he uses Pieces are similarly varied.

    One feature that he started using recently is auto-complete. “Auto-complete was pretty useful on some of the boilerplate code that I use in my C++ and CMake projects, where I copy certain things a lot and there's not really a good way to abstract it out. So, Pieces auto-completed it and nearly took care of everything for me.”

<Accordion title="Pieces User Stories: Research effectively & store a version history">
    Karam hasn’t been using Pieces for long, but he’s well on his way to becoming a power user. In his first two days as a full-time developer, he used Pieces, “a sh*t ton.”

    Perhaps his most versatile use of Pieces is to save various solutions for a bug so that he can test them later— and find them in the future.

    Commander Mark has been here since the beginning. As one of our founding engineers, he spends most of his time deep in the code, and the rest of his time talking about code with the rest of the team.

    Mark uses Pieces every day, and the way he uses it shifts constantly. “Right now, I use Pieces to save a lot of my responses that are not available on the web. Specifically with any sort of command I would use with the G Cloud APIs, as well as small templates of code, like my try catches— I’ll actually just right-click, hit “Send to Pieces” and auto-complete them into IntelliJ, VS Code or any one of my editors.”
